Cantor’s\nwork unleashed a storm of criticism: not only mathematicians, but also\nphilosophers and theologians attacked the temerity of one who would bring\nthe methods of mathematical science to bear on the hitherto sacrosanct do-\nmain of the infinite. Frege was supportive of Cantor’s embrace of the actual\ninfinite, recognizing its importance for the future of mathematics.

Von Neumann soon joined the discussions with the ENIAC group at\nthe Moore School.\n\nThe Colossus with its 1,500 vacuum tubes was already an engineer-\ning marvel; the ENIAC with 18,000 tubes was simply astonishing. The\nconventional wisdom of the time was that no such assemblage could do\nreliable work; it was believed that a tube would be bound to fail every few\nseconds. It was the chief engineer on the ENIAC project, John Presper\nEckert, Jr., who was largely responsible for the project’s success. Eckert\ninsisted on very high standards of component reliability. Tubes were oper-\nated at extremely conservative power levels, and the failure rate was kept\nto three tubes per week.

Finally, we wish to elicit discussion.\n\nObstacles\n\nShould liberal arts campuses engage with the digital humanities movement? There\nare several serious arguments for disengagement, including problems of logistics,\ninfrastructure, and campus identity.\n\nOne institutional objection stems from the size and concomitant resource\nbase that characterizes most small liberal arts colleges. Because of their smail scale,\nsuch colleges and. universities may lack the proper infrastructure to support digital\nhumanities work. For many digital humanists, the key piece of college infrastruc-\nture is the digital humanities center. In her Survey of Digital Humanities Centers\nin the United States, Diane Zorich defines the center as “an entity where new media\nand technologies are used for humanities-based research, teaching, and intellectual\nengagement and experimentation. The goals of the center are to further humani-\nties scholarship, create new forms of knowledge, and explore technology’s impact\non humanities-based disciplines” (4). Functionally, such centers provide locations\nfor interdisciplinary, interdepartmental collaboration; centralized computing sup-\nport and expertise for a variety of projects; and help in securing funding. They\nare resource centers, information clearing houses, interpersonal networking nodes,\nand advocates for the field. These centers are comparatively new in the university\nlandscape; the centers in Zorich’s survey have a median founding date of 1999 (9).\nZorich also finds a typical trajectory for the development of most centers in which\nan initial stimulus, “a grant, a strategic discussion, or an entrepreneurial individual,”\nstarts a development that moves in an unstructured fashion “from project (singular\nactivity) to program (long-term activity) to center (multiple activities)” (9-10).

Moreover, digital humanities centers are\nrelatively new arrivals on liberal arts campuses, which makes them potentially less\nappealing than already established paradepartmental entities, such as teaching and\nlearning or writing centers, which are fairly common at small colleges. As members\nof the Digital Campus podcast noted, life as an isolated digital humanist is a chal-\nlenge, especially without the place to meet, support for getting grants, and technical\nstaff that a center provides (Cohen, French, Kelly, and Scheinfeldt). How can digital\nhumanists assemble the combination of skills and technology infrastructure needed\nto conduct digital humanities work such as coding, media production and aggrega-\ntion, and the creation and development of information architecture, not to mention\nconducting the essential work within a humanities subject? Furthermore, the digital\nhumanities center integrates professional populations along with personal skill sets:\nfaculty members, librarians, and technologists. Without an anchoring department,\nindividual digital humanists at small colleges often lack the social capital to create\nor participate in already existing cross-sector teams.\n\nSmail colleges may not have accumulated the critical mass to create a digital\nhumanities center due to a third obstacle to the digital humanities in the liberal\narts world, namely that sector’s pedagogical focus. Not only is a digital humanities\ncenter inappropriately resource demanding, but such centers do not usually focus\non undergraduate teaching, the central task of a liberal arts campus. While many\ndigital humanities centers do support some teaching, their ultimate goal is to “train\nthe next generation of digital humanities researchers, scholars, and professionals”\n(Zorich, 20). Those receiving such training are more likely to be graduate students\nor interested faculty seeking professional development. Both cases are outside the\nmainstream of liberal education practice—teaching undergraduates.\n\nWhile defining liberal education is nontrivial—in fact, it’s a classic conversation\ngenerator—it is not controversial to recognize one generally inoffensive descrip-\ntion: schooling focused on undergraduate education. As Jo Ellen Parker describes\nit, “The defining characteristics of liberal education in this logic are not disciplines\nbut practices—practices like group study, undergraduate research, faculty mentor-\ning, student presentations, and other forms of active learning.” To the extent that\nliberal arts campuses follow this suite of practices, they are working in a way very\ndifferent from a large university producing digital content for general consump-\ntion. Liberal arts campuses devote the balance of their energies to the classroom\nrather than the outside world of content consumers, the residential student body\nin discussion-based clusters rather than the res publica, small groups of physically\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:33 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

Their tradition, reward structure, student expectation, and alumni perspec-\ntive all turn on this richly rewarding student—professor interaction rather than more\npublic, outward-facing types of sharing and publication. Therefore, on-campus crit-\nics could construe work in the classic digital humanities as marginal or off mission—\nperhaps dangerously so, during the Great Recession era of funding crisis.\n\nIf the pedagogical nature of liberal education presents a problem for practic-\ning digital humanities, then the unclear identity of digital humanities offers yet\nanother difficulty. It is famously difficult for observers and participants to agree on\na definition of digital humanities; and, as Matthew Kirschenbaum has observed,\nessays defining the term are already genre pieces (55). Consider the definitional\nrange Kirschenbaum explores from the perspective of literature departments: digi-\ntal humanities are based on technologies, or analytical methods, or the emergence\nof certain research-supporting social structures demarcated by funding or social\nmovement dynamics or network topology.’ Other sources offer a similar diversity.\nThe digital humanities are about scholars, or about projects, or tools, or about tech-\nnology itself. They are the entire humanities in transformation, or a narrow strand\ntherein. The digital world invades the humanities, forcing us to think through new\ncategories and reinvent our world, or cyberculture nestles firmly within our estab-\nlished critical theory tradition (“How Do You Define”). Whatever digital humani-\nties is, it is emergent, dynamic, inclusive, evolving, and very fresh. It is an ongoing,\nPoundian “make it new!”\n\nWe can suggest many reasons for this definitional uncertainty. Although the\ndigital humanities have a history of practice under various names—for exam-\nple, humanities computing—the current name, digital humanities, remains rela-\ntively new within the academy. Kirschenbaum traces its origin to the publication of\nBlackwell’s Companion to Digital Humanities in 2004 (Schreibman, Siemens, and\nUnsworth), the creation of the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations in\n2005, and the launch of the Digital Humanities Initiative (now the Office of Digi-\ntal Humanities) at the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 2006.\nBeyond the scholastic history, digital technologies change rapidly, as do the practices\naround them, driving digital humanities into a state of perpetual reinvention (web-\nsites, then Web 2.0, then apps, then games, then . . .}. Additionally, the most recent\nrecession has perhaps crimped academic progress generally, constricting budgets\nfor people and materials, slowing the output of recognizable digital humanities\nwork. Interdisciplinarity presents its usual challenges: difficulty in winning cham-\npions and resources in a discipline-structured environment. Similarly, the cross-\npopulation nature of digital humanities work, which requires faculty members,\nlibrarians, and technologists, makes it hard to garner interest in digital humanities\nprojects. The combination of newness, technology change, and inclusion of mul-\ntiple sectors and disciplines make (re)defining the digital humanities both prob-\nlematic and necessary.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:33 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\n| 373\n\f"

For example, the classic production-versus-theory\nargument (opposing hands-on work to reflective criticism, an argument about\nresources and ethos), a familiar one to the institutionalization of film and media\nstudies, recurs here. To do digital humanities is to create digital humanities proj-\nects, argued Stephen Ramsay during a high-profile MLA 2011 discussion: “I think\nDigital Humanities is about building things .. . if you aren’t building, you are not\nengaged in the ‘methodologization’ of the humanities, which, to me, is the hallmark\nof the discipline that was already decades old when I came to it” (“Who's In and\nWho's Out”). Such a focus might describe the field’s developmental arc: “There’s\nalways been a profound—and profoundly exciting and enabling—commonality to\neveryone who finds their way to digital humanities. And that commonality, I think,\ninvolves moving from reading and critiquing to building and making” (Ramsay, “On\nBuilding”). Ramsay sees the process of creation as radically different from that of\nstudy (viz. critical media studies). Production summons up a distinct set of compe-\ntencies, resources, and challenges, all in an especially emergent way that the observer\nor critic has no immediate access to.\n\nThe implications of Ramsay's definition exacerbate the small college produc-\ntion problem outlined earlier. By extension, small liberal arts colleges cannot pur-\nsue digital humanities projects due to their lack of centers and incompatibility of\nmission, and their inability to produce further disables them from truly engaging\nwith the field on both individual and institutional levels. Put another way, the defi-\nnitional problem makes it more difficult to argue for resource allocation to efforts\nstakeholders cannot readily apprehend.\n\nThe combination of small institutional size, lack of supporting infrastructure,\npedagogical focus, and uncertain definition yields still another challenge for the\ndigital humanities at small liberal arts colleges. These campuses lack visibility in\nthe digital humanities world, as it is constituted through social networks, projects,\nand. conferences. The relative lack of visibility for small liberal arts colleges in this\nworld is clear from a survey of Twitter activity (see Dan Cohen’s Twitter list, “Digi-\ntal Humanists”) or from a glance at Project Bamboo, a multi-institutional planning\nproject aimed at discussing shared approaches to the digital humanities. The latter’s\nplanning and discussion were dominated by research universities, from planning\nthrough workshops (2008-2010) to the 2010 project group’s composition (Millon,\nProject Bamboo).\n\nOr consider participation in the Digital Humanities Conference, the annual\ninternational conference for digital scholarship in the humanities, sponsored by the\nAlliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). At the 2010 conference, of\nthe one hundred and forty institutions of various types listed on the program, only\ntwo were North American small liberal arts colleges. Granted, the conference took\nplace in London; but, even at Digital Humanities 2009 in Maryland, five presenters\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:33 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

But if digital humanists at small liberal\narts colleges cannot create projects, then they will also miss out on this part of the\ncommunity. The numbers for the NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant pro-\ngram bear this out. According to the Summary Findings of NEH Digital Humani-\nties Start-Up Grants (2007-2010), of the 1,110 grant applications, less than 50 came\nfrom liberal arts colleges, while over 400 came from doctoral research institutions\n(Office of Digital Humanities, 18). The same report includes potential evidence of\nthe effects of these perception issues. One principal investigator on a start-up grant\nwho had so far failed to secure additional funding refers to “hesitation on the part\nof granting agencies to fund projects that rely on undergraduate work” (Office of\nDigital Humanities, 31). If small liberal arts colleges and universities participate in\nproduction or even study, that work lacks presence in the overall movement. That\nlack of impact can rebound on a small campus, creating a negative incentive for\nincreased contribution.\n\nHand in hand with poor visibility comes the isolation of digital humanists\nworking at small liberal arts colleges. Isolation impacts individuals, their work, and\ntheir projects in general. Such digital humanists lack physically proximate colleagues\nwith whom they can collaborate or discuss their work. This disconnection reduces\ntheir opportunities for learning about standards, resources, and ongoing projects\nfrom peers. One result is that their work may not be interoperable with other proj-\nects or may even reduplicate efforts (Davis and Dombrowski). Ata number of large\nresearch institutions, digital humanities centers play a key isolation reduction role\nby providing technology; expertise; information about tools, standards, and ongo-\ning projects; as well as introductions to prominent figures in the digital humanities\ncommunity who can serve as guides and mentors.\n\nThe Twitter network, the blogosphere, and other online community venues\nand. shared resources may alleviate these problems to a certain extent, but digital\nhumanists at small campuses are still disconnected from in-person meetings and\ncollaborations. They can also feel isolated by the particular political and academic\nstructures of their own institutions. Perhaps the liberal arts campus’s residential\nethos and emphasis on face-to-face teaching acculturates humanists on those cam-\npuses to prefer collocated conversations more strongly than do their colleagues in\nother sectors. While the impact of isolation is magnified for the scholar working at\nan institution without a digital humanities center, such organizations are hardly a\npanacea.

One answer is simple assent to\neach charge. A lack of institutional support, lines not opened, courses not approved,\nfunds unallocated: there are many avenues for disengagement either at the policy\nlevel or in practical terms. A second type of response, however, evokes actual lib-\neral arts digital humanities practices, making these available for analysis. The first\ncategory of response requires little adumbration here, partly because discussion of\nit involves proving an absence, or establishing a negative. The second category, cur-\nrent practice, is more interesting, especially as many projects address the objections\noutlined earlier.\n\nTo begin, we are seeing the creation of some digital humanities centers—at\nthe University of Richmond, Hamilton College, and Occidental College—though\nwith a particular liberal arts inflection. The Digital Scholarship Lab at the Univer-\nsity of Richmond enjoys, perhaps, the highest level of institutional support, since\nnoted digital humanist Ed Ayers is the president of the university. The lab’s mission\nstatement makes clear its production focus: “The Digital Scholarship Lab devel-\nops innovative digital humanities projects that contribute to research and teach-\ning at and beyond the University of Richmond. It seeks to reach a wide audience\nby developing projects that integrate thoughtful interpretation in the humanities\nand social sciences with innovations in new media” (“About the Digital Scholarship\nLab”). In addition to continuing projects like the History Engine started by Ayers\nat the University of Virginia, the lab also supports new projects including two that\nhave received Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants from the National Endowment\nfor the Humanities: “Landscapes of the American Past: Visualizing Emancipation”\nand “Visualizing the Past: Tools and Techniques for Understanding Historical Pro-\ncesses.” This lab, with its focus on production of tools and projects, seems most like\nthe digital humanities center familiar from large research institutions, although at\nleast two of its projects—the History Engine and “Americans in Paris’~provide\nopportunities for undergraduate contributions integrated into courses (“History\nEngine,” Jones).\n\nBy contrast, both Hamilton and Occidental Colleges have a more explicit peda-\ngogical focus integrated into the overall mission of their centers. Each also secured\ngrant funding from the Liberal Arts College Program of the Andrew W. Mellon\nFoundation in 2010 (“Mellon Awards $800K for Digital Humanities Initiative”;\n“Occidental Awarded $700,000 Mellon Grant for Digital Scholarship”).

At the same time, this initiative illustrates\nthe challenges of definition and visibility for the digital humanities on small liberal\narts campuses. When one of the authors of this chapter visited there, she was struck\nby the repeated comment, “I didn’t know I was doing digital humanities.” Recog-\nnizing that other small liberal arts colleges do not have the resources to establish a\ncenter, Hamilton College is currently piloting some infrastructure to support these\ncollections and wants to create a shared infrastructure in the cloud that can be used\nby other colleges (Simons, Nieves, and Hamlin). Essentially, Hamilton could act as\na digital humanities center for other small liberal arts colleges.\n\nThe pedagogical focus becomes even clearer in our third example of a liberal\narts digital humanities center. At Occidental College, the Center for Digital Learn-\ning and Research (CDLR) is part of a larger vision to transform the college for\nthe twenty-first century. Like other centers, the CDLR centralizes expertise and\nbecomes a nexus for collaboration on campus. Its staff consists of existing positions\nfrom both the library and information technology with the addition of its director\nand grant-funded postdocs (“Center for Digital Learning and Research”). A sum-\nmer institute for faculty and ongoing support of faculty projects aim to transform\nteaching and learning. As part of this plan, the digital humanities provide an avenue\nfor envisioning a new kind of education in which “faculty and students use digital\nresources to pose new questions, discover and create knowledge in distributed and\n\n \n\ncollaborative ways, work with scholars and information globally without physically\nleaving campus, and simultaneously gather and share data in the field” (Chamber-\nlain). The mission of this center, then, explicitly focuses on undergraduate education\nrather than on the production of digital humanities projects. Instead, digital meth-\nodologies are seen as a means to achieving that classroom-based end. While such\ncenters share with centers at research institutions the functions of offering a loca-\ntion for interdisciplinary collaboration, thereby centralizing expertise and attract-\ning funding, they have a distinct mission that focuses on undergraduate education,\nakin to the focus of teaching and learning centers and in keeping with the identity\nof small liberal arts colleges.\n\nDespite these examples, most liberal arts campuses do not currently maintain\na digital humanities center, nor do they plan on doing so in the near future. The\nfirst challenge we identified is thus only partially addressed by current practice. If\nthe center model is not a normative one, can these small colleges and. universities\ndevelop other institutional anchors to support the multidisciplinary, collaborative\nwork of digital humanities? We have observed other structures emerging that ful-\nfill the various functions of the center by unbundling them, including community\nbuilding and on-campus advocacy and developing computing expertise and sup-\nport for finding funding.\n\nTo combat the sense of isolation and lack of visibility on campus, one pro-\ngrammatic function focuses on creating a sense of community.

Inspired by their faculty, stu-\ndents at Haverford and Bryn Mawr also created an undergraduate digital humani-\nties group that hosted “Re:Humanities,’ an undergraduate digital humanities con-\nference that pulled in students from other institutions like Hamilton College. These\ncommunities have helped advocate for the value of digital humanities work and\nraise its profile in the campus community.\n\nPart of advocacy for the digital humanities on campus includes integrating it\nwith an institution’s mission and culture. For example, both Hamilton and Occiden-\ntal Colleges have a pedagogical focus for their digital humanities centers in keeping\nwith their institution’s academic mission. From a different angle, the Humanities\nProgram at the University of Puget Sound includes digital work in what is osten-\nsibly a nondigital program, the Humanities Teaching Collective, directed. by Pro-\nfessor Kent Hooper. Viewing the digital as a necessary part of humanities today,\nHooper has integrated a collaboratively taught course on digital humanities within\nthe humanities sequence at the University Puget Sound. When the associate dean\nwas asked about what sort of structure they had to support the digital humanities,\nshe replied, “Kent is our structure” (DeMarais). Such linkage of digital humanities\nwith one person on campus may pose a danger. That person may be dismissed as an\nearly adopter or the effort may run the risk of losing impetus if that person leaves\n(Moore). Nevertheless, Hooper has been able to integrate the digital humanities into\nPuget Sound’s humanities program with the support of the administration, library,\nand information technology.\n\nWe find a similar integration of digital humanities into existing campus cur-\nricular programs at Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts. While large insti-\ntutions need centers to operate outside curricular structures (i.e., outside depart-\nmienits) to promote interdisciplinary collaboration, at small colleges the tradition\nof interdisciplinary work is linked to the values of liberal education. The Associa-\ntion of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) includes interdisciplinary,\nintegrative learning among its list of essential learning outcomes for liberal edu-\ncation. At Wheaton College, students have to take connected courses that link not\njust across disciplines but also across divisions as required by the integrative learn-\ning program, Connections. Out of that context arose the Lexomics Project, which\ncombines computer science, statistics, and Old English texts (LeBlanc, Armstrong,\nand Gousie, “Lexomics”). Lexomics received an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up\nGrant in 2008, and students contributed to the project which uses text mining to\nstudy Old English texts and determine authorship based on stylistic characteristics.\nThe project secured additional funding in the form of an NEH Preservation and\nAccess Grant in 2011 (“Four Professors Win NEH Grants”).

Both the University of\nPuget Sound and Wheaton College demonstrate that one successful strategy for\npromoting digital humanities is to find those existing structures and programs on\ncampus that might fit with the digital humanities and to leverage them.\n\nA third center function we see unbundled on the small college campus is com-\nputing expertise and support. Rather than creating a separate center, many col-\nleges take advantage of the existing structures that already centralize computing\nand information support on campus. At the University of Puget Sound, the Library,\nMedia, and Information Services Committee plays an active role in supporting their\nhumanities program. At Willamette University, Michael Spalti, Associate University\nLibrarian for Systems, essentially has played the role of a digital humanities center\ndirector: he was project director for an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant\n(“Bridging the Gap: Connecting Authors to Museum and Archival Collections”); he\nwas the driving force behind Willamette’s involvement in Project Bamboo; he orga-\nnized and found funding for faculty workshops; and he has been a planner and the\nWillamette contact for digital humanities collaboration within NITLE. Similarly, at\nLewis and Clark College, the library is supporting a new NEH Digital Humanities\nStart-Up Grant project, “Intellectual Property and International Collaboration in\nthe Digital Humanities: The Moroccan Jewish Community Archives” (Kosansky).\nAt Occidental College, the Center for Digital Learning and Research (CDLR) is\nconnected to a developing Academic Commons in the library. It also pulls together\n\n \n\nstaff from the library and IT. At Wheaton College, support for participation in the\nText Encoding Initiative (TED comes from Library and Information Services, with\nmaterials coming from the college archives.\n\nIt's notable that most of these collaborative support examples occur where the\ninformation technology and library organizations are merged, or where a close\nworking relationship exists between the two. Hamilton College’s HILLgroup (Ham-\nilton Information and Learning Liaisons) and Information Commons represent\nalmost a decade of collaboration among faculty, librarians, and technologists.\nWheaton and Occidental also have merged organizations. And at the University of\nPuget Sound, inclusion of digital work within the Humanities Teaching Collective\nmodels collaboration among faculty, librarians, and technologists typical of digital\nhumanities projects. Essentially, these colleges have already centralized services in a\nway that can support digital humanities projects without having to create a separate\nstructure to centralize expertise. Further, in these cases, small campus size, rather\nthan being an obstacle to digital humanities work, may become an enabling virtue\nbecause it obviates the need for a separate center to house such work.\n\nIf these unbundled approaches do represent a separate mode of supporting dig-\nital humanities, their ability to secure grant funding represents an additional mea-\nsure of their success.

While this funding level does not reach that\nof major digital humanities centers, it does demonstrate that major funding enti-\nties see the unbundled model as a viable alternative to digital humanities centers.\n\nThe presence of unbundled digital humanities center functions at small liberal\narts colleges suggests that centers may, in fact, not be required to enable effective dig-\nital humanities work. It may well be that the functions described are waypoints on\nthe journey to building up the critical mass needed for a digital humanities center.\nThen again, they may represent an alternate method of supporting digital humani-\nties at small liberal arts colleges, one that will never lead to a center. Centers arose\nat large research institutions to help centralize efforts of community building, com-\nputing expertise, and advocacy spread across a large campus; the small size of liberal\narts colleges mitigates the need for a separate structure to perform this centralizing\nfunction. In that case, assessing the viability of the digital humanities at small lib-\neral arts colleges by the presence or lack of a digital humanities center is applying\nthe wrong criterion to the question.\n\nAs we have seen, existing campus structures and intracampus collaborations\ncan approximate the function of digital humanities centers for centralizing exper-\ntise and promoting interdisciplinary work on campus, but they do not necessar-\nily help with the challenges of isolation and lack of visibility in the broader digital\nhumanities community. For those challenges, digital humanists at small colleges\nhave turned to interinstitutional collaboration. Many of the liberal arts colleges that\nhave successful digital humanities activities have benefitted from relationships with\nresearch institutions. Kathryn Tomasek at Wheaton College has described how her\nproximity to Brown University has allowed her and her colleagues to learn TEL and\nhear speakers from the digital humanities world (“Brown Groupies?”). Likewise,\nOccidental College leveraged speakers from the University of Southern California\nand the University of California, Los Angeles, for their grant-funded summer insti-\ntute on digital scholarship. Essentially, these small colleges take advantage of the net-\nworking and professional development opportunities of digital humanities centers\nat large institutions, especially when enabled by physical proximity. Regional THAT-\nCamps offer another nearby networking and professional development opportu-\nnity to connect digital humanists at a variety of institutions. One of the authors of\nthis chapter helped plan THATCamp Liberal Arts Colleges, a THATCamp focused\non institutional type rather than region that seeks specifically to counter the isola-\ntion of digital humanists at small colleges while raising their visibility within the\nlarger community (“THATCamp: The Humanities”; “THATCamp Liberal Arts”).\n\nSmall colleges may also join collaborative, interinstitutional digital humanities\n\n \n\nprojects supported by large research institutions.

The project\nwon a NITLE Community Contribution Award for Digital Humanities and the\nUndergraduate in October 2010 (“Digital Humanities and the Undergraduate”).\nSince small colleges commonly do not have infrastructure or expertise to support\nlarge-scale digital projects, opportunities like these provide effective means to inte-\ngrate their faculty, staff, and students into the digital humanities world.\n\nAlthough many of these collaborations are organized around specific proj-\nects, we are also seeing large-scale multi-institutional projects aimed at building\nresources and pooling expertise. These are constructed to match the needs of both\nsmall liberal arts colleges and large research institutions. For example, the TAPAS\nproject, or TEI Archiving, Preservation, and Access Service, aggregates expertise and\nlabor of technology staff at small liberal arts colleges to help publish and archive\nhigh-quality scholarly data marked up according to TEE standards (“A New Part\nof Your Digital Humanities Toolkit”). Such data markup offers a relatively acces-\nsible way to engage students in digital humanities work, as shown by the Wheaton\nCollege Digital History Project, in which students transcribe and markup materi-\nals from the Wheaton College archive (Tomasek et al.). Since small colleges often\nlack resources such as server space, technical expertise, and advanced XML publica-\ntion tools, publication and archiving of this work becomes a challenge. The TAPAS\nproject started as Publishing TE Documents for Small Colleges, a project funded\nby an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) planning grant to Whea-\nton College in collaboration with Dickinson and Mount Holyoke Colleges. In the\ncourse of the planning grant, participants realized that the service was also needed\nby large institutions, and Brown University is now partnering with the project to\nbe the base of the service.\n\nThis kind of collaboration recognizes common needs at small and large insti-\ntutions while integrating small colleges as equal partners in a productive process. It\ngoes a long way toward raising the profile of small colleges in the digital humanities\ncommunity and demonstrating their capacity to make meaningful contributions\neven at the level of producing tools. In addition, such multi-institutional collabo-\nrations have the added benefit of combating the tendency to form silos that Zorich\nidentified for digital humanities centers. Due to their small size, liberal arts colleges\nhave no illusions about their ability to go it alone. Their needs may prove a useful\nindicator of needs within the digital humanities community as a whole, needs that\nwould benefit from the approach of large-scale shared infrastructure. Liberal arts\ncolleges can thus help chart a more widely distributed version of the digital humani-\nties in the future.\n\nA related response to our opening objections involves the strategic use of\nresources.

Liberal arts\ncampuses are smaller than most others and have recently suffered from the general\nrecession. It is therefore appropriate for them to advance on several well-chosen\naxes, rather than across a general front. If this model is correct, then we should\nexpect to see visible signs of liberal arts digital humanities engagement (conference\nresentations, published articles, Web 2.0 discussions) only in certain areas.\n\nSo far we have concentrated on ways in which small liberal arts colleges have\nstrategically approximated the functions of large digital humanities centers by estab-\nishing their own centers, finding preexisting structures with analogous functions,\nand. forming strategic partnerships with each other and larger institutions. Now\nwe turn to an aspect of digital humanities linked to the particular identity of small\niberal arts colleges—that is, their focus on undergraduate education. Liberal arts\ncampuses focus digital humanities work specifically in the classroom experience,\ncombining digital humanities research with teaching. Rather than emphasizing pro-\nessionally mediated content and tool creation (cf. Ramsay, earlier), this approach\nturns faculty energies away from the production model, defining a very different\norm of digital humanities.\n\nIna recent Digital Humanities Quarterly article, Chris Blackwell and Thomas\nMartin point to the prevalence of undergraduate research in the sciences, especially\nstudent-faculty collaborative research, but note the relative dearth of such exam-\n\n \n\nles in the humanities where the independent student thesis is the norm. This lack\nof collaboration is particularly troubling to small liberal arts colleges because such\ncollaborative research, with close interaction between students and faculty, is a hall-\nmark of their educational model (Lopatto). Mark Schantz points to more barriers\nto undergraduate research in the humanities: limited expertise, the independent\nresearcher model that is typical of the humanities, and challenges of scalability in\nfinding faculty time and attention to support undergraduate research (“Undergrad-\nuate Research,” 26). The independent thesis model, however, is one existing struc-\nture that has allowed some undergraduates to pursue digital humanities research,\nturning a problem to an advantage. For example, Jen Rajchel produced the first\nonline senior thesis in the English Department at Bryn Mawr College: “Mooring\nGaps: Marianne Moore’s Bryn Mawr Poetry” (Davis, Rajchel). While the idea of the\nindividual thesis is a traditional practice at Bryn Mawr, Rajchel departed from the\nnorm in constructing her thesis online. In this way, she was able to innovate within\nan existing program rather than completely break from tradition. Such measured\nprogress may help make the digital humanities more palatable on the liberal arts\ncampus.\n\nCollaborative undergraduate research in the humanities, however, represents a\ndeparture from the norm for small liberal arts colleges. Blackwell and Martin argue\npersuasively that the digital humanities, along with some changes in practice, can\nopen up collaborative research options for classical studies undergraduates both in\nand out of the classroom. Many of the examples mentioned previously, such as the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:33 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

Although the project is based at the Center for Hellenic Studies of\nHarvard University, undergraduates at the College of the Holy Cross, Furman Uni-\nversity, and the University of Houston collaborate on it. Recently, one of the authors\nof this chapter interviewed Mary Ebbot, coeditor of the Homer Multitext Project\nand associate professor of classics at the College of the Holy Cross about how she has\nintegrated this project into undergraduate courses. In a Fall 2008 advanced Greek\ncourse on Homer, Professor Ebbot had her students take responsibility for one sec-\ntion of Homer; transcribe, translate, and provide commentary on the scholia, or\nmarginal annotations; and map the text to the digital images of the manuscript.\nThese high-resolution images allowed the students better views of the manuscript\nthan were available to the handful of traditional classicists who had access to the\nphysical manuscripts in the past. Now, not only have the images been made avail-\nable online, but they are even available as an iPad app (Smith, “Touchy the Venutus\nA’). In 2010, Holy Cross students did similar work as part of a summer research\nprogram. That fall, Ebbot’s colleague, Neel Smith, organized a group of students,\nincluding first years, to volunteer to spend their Friday afternoons doing the same\nwork (Smith, “New Content, New Contributors”). These students have developed a\nresearch community with which they share insights about how to decipher the writ-\ning on Byzantine manuscripts. Part of the intellectual excitement experienced by\nstudents stems from the opportunity to generate original work on primary material,\nrather than rehashing old arguments or synthesizing secondary literature (“Ebbot”).\n\nThe Homer Multitext Project approaches the lab model familiar from the sci-\nences. Amy Earhart suggests that the practices of the science lab offer a potential\nmodel for collaboration in the digital humanities, with students working under\nsupervision by faculty and older students until they are ready for independent\nresearch (31-33). Collaborative work on a common project within the lab helps\nprofessionalize students in their discipline of classics. The collaborative model also\nhelps with issues of scalability: students contribute to faculty projects, rather than\ntaking away from faculty research time; and they support each other, rather than\nrelying solely on faculty members for support and supervision. Overall, while the\nindependent researcher model may represent an easier transition for integrating\ndigital methodologies into undergraduate research in the humanities, the collab-\norative model will be more productive in the end, more in line with practice in the\ndigital humanities, more in keeping with the world of webs and networks, and there-\nfore a better option for the future of liberal education.\n\nWe should also consider the Homer Multitext Project as an example of applied\nlearning, another of the key learning outcomes for liberal education identified by\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:33 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

In terms of pedagogical theory, this is problem-based learning, a peda-\ngogical approach in which groups of students attack a problem with a real-world\napplication. In “Bringing Our Brains to the Humanities: Increasing the Value of\nOur Classes while Supporting Our Futures,” Sheila Cavanaugh argues that typical\nhumanities classrooms do not take into account recent pedagogical theory; she sug-\ngests problem-based learning as one potentially fruitful and corrective approach.\nThe applied-learning opportunities of digital humanities projects make them espe-\ncially ripe for this approach. By giving students a limited amount of information—\nsay, a section of the Homer manuscript—and some guidance, faculty can limit the\nscope and scaffold the learning process. Under this model of learning, students\nshould learn both the process of inquiry and the actual content answer to the prob-\nlem. After such scaffolded learning experiences, students will be ready for more\nindependent research of the Homer manuscripts. This process-over-product focus\ndistinguishes the digital humanities as practiced at small liberal arts colleges from\nthe production focus in much of the digital humanities community.\n\nFor liberal arts colleges, applied learning has further benefits when it moves\ninto the local community. Consider SmartChoices, a project led by Jack Dougherty,\nassociate professor of educational studies at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecti-\ncut. Winner of NITLE’s Community Contribution Award in 2010, SmartChoices is\n“a Web-based map and data sorting application that empowers parents to navigate\nand compare the growing number of public school options in metropolitan Hart-\nford” (Dougherty). It was developed at Trinity by a team of students, faculty, and\nacademic computing staff in collaboration with two nonprofit urban school reform\norganizations. Students on the project engaged in several high-impact practices val-\nued in liberal education—including applied learning, service learning, and under-\ngraduate research——and also developed their knowledge as citizens (Kuh). This kind\nof public engagement makes a powerful argument for the value of liberal education\nand digital humanities. Our undergraduates can play an important role translat-\ning our digital humanities work to the general public. Not all of these students will\nbecome digital humanists, but they will take a digital humanities perspective with\nthem wherever they go, after having had an impact on their local communities.\n\nThe focus on the undergraduate curriculum at small liberal arts colleges offers\nthe digital humanities a path for expansion beyond research centers at large univer-\nsities to other types of institutions and beyond. While teaching is obviously impor-\ntant for most faculty members (allowing for variance by campus type), the discus-\nsion of pedagogy in the digital humanities has largely focused on teaching the field\nof digital humanities or preparing future digital humanists. By contrast, small lib-\neral arts colleges focus on how the digital humanities effectively fulfill the learning\noutcomes of undergraduate liberal education. Thus they answer objections to their\nengagement with the digital humanities with their own brand of digital humanities,\none predicated upon integration within undergraduate teaching and shared with\nall institutions that teach undergraduates.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:33 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

The examples we cite over-\ncome some problems in an indirect or oblique way. Taken together, perhaps we are\nwitnessing a fork in the digital humanities development path, to borrow a term\nfrom software development. Liberal arts campuses have taken the digital humani-\nties source code and built a different application with it than their research univer-\nsity peers are currently constructing. Their focus is often on teaching and learning,\nnot open content production. Institutional shapes differ from the now-classic digi-\ntal humanities center. This looks like a specifically liberal arts route across the digi-\ntal humanities landscape. Perhaps these small colleges and universities will decide,\nas an aggregate, not to follow that path any longer, either disengaging en masse or\ngenerating small-scale versions of research university models. But if those scenar-\nios do not occur and the current record persists, liberal arts colleges and universi-\nties may break new ground with their focus on undergraduate education and their\noccasionally unbundied/uncentered support model.\n\nIf that is correct, then two implications arise. First, as liberal arts digital humani-\nties work grows, those campuses will be sending undergraduates into digital human-\nities graduate studies programs. The research-I] university will have a different type\nof humanist to train, one with a new and distinct background. These fresh graduate\nstudents may well present a deeper interest in teaching and learning implications\nthan their peers, for example. They may also have a face-to-face understanding of\ndigital humanities work. They may consider the humanities in terms of networks\nrather than centers, as a diffuse web rather than unified field.\n\nSecond, if liberal arts campuses continue this work and share some proportion\nof it with the world via the open web, then that work will connect with small cam-\npuses beyond the United States and that nation’s unique liberal education experi-\nence. The system of American-style liberal arts colleges abroad, for example, could\nadopt the liberal arts path rather than the research university version. That group’s\nvery active library collaboration, the AMICAL consortium, could play a role in this\nby sharing practices. And as American-style liberal education flourishes in hitherto\nunfamiliar markets like China, this liberal arts brand of the digital humanities may\nfollow. More broadly, a global education system eager to boost training during a\nworldwide recession may well find much utility in the liberal arts digital humanities\nmodel, grounded as it is in teaching and learning. A humanities-oriented cyberin-\nfrastructure would support such international, interinstitutional collaboration if it\ndeveloped shared workspaces, collaborative workflows, and other linked work tools\n(Unsworth, “Our Cultural Commonwealth”).\n\nWe wish to conclude by expanding our discussions beyond institutional\nconstraints.

First, the\nliberal arts emphasis on involving undergraduates, local communities, and multi-\nple campuses might contribute to a sense of humanities belonging to everyone, not\njust trained professionals. Standing at the intersection between the general public\nand. academia, undergraduates are particularly well positioned to bridge the gap,\nperforming public outreach for academic digital humanities work. They may also\nfill the same needs as the public in crowdsourcing projects, while avoiding concerns\nabout minimum expertise. In the liberal arts tradition, helping students become\nactive citizens engaged in civic life is a longstanding good, supported by nondigital\nprograms like service learning (Schneider). Perhaps this sector’s digital humanities\napproach keys into that outcome, developing a capacity for new forms of citizenship\nina networked world. It may specifically help bridge the widening gap between aca-\ndemic humanities and broader American culture. Purther, the liberal arts emphasis\non lifelong learning could nudge some graduates to play a digital humanities advo-\ncacy role for decades to come.\n\nSecond, the rise of intercampus projects not affiliated with a single institution\ncould reinforce the perception that digital humanities involves fluid, collaborative\nefforts. In an era when the humanities in general are under terrific budgetary pres-\nsures, such hacking of public awareness could prove influential. The liberal arts\ndigital humanities fork may appear as a form of humanism oriented toward the\ncommonweal. Understood in those terms, it could play a role in arguing for the\nhumanities as a public good in policy and budgeting discussions.\n\nThis returns our “fork” back to the very nature of liberal education once again.\nOne aspect of the liberal arts ethos is community engagement. As Jo Ellen Parker\nnotes, “this approach [to understanding liberal education] tends to value the\ndevelopment of skills specifically believed to be central to effective citizenship—\nliteracy, numeracy, sometimes public speaking, scientific and statistical literacy,\nfamiliarity with social and political science, and critical thinking. It tends to value\ncurricular engagement with current social and political issues alongside the extra-\ncurricular development of ethical reflection and socially responsible character\ntraits in students, seeing student life as an educational sphere in its own right in\nwhich leadership, rhetorical, and community-building skills can be practiced.”\nThis pedagogical goal of boosting students’ civic engagement is a very different\nacademic process than that of publishing digital humanities projects to the web\nor other venues. The latter is a kind of product, a scholarly “output” shared with\nthe world. In contrast the set of liberal arts digital humanities practices we've\noutlined makes more sense in terms of process. The skills of collaboration across\ndisciplines and institutions, working with primary sources and archives, strategi-\ncally selecting technologies under financial constraints, and working within net-\nworks and connecting with local communities: these practices start from micro-\ncommunities then ultimately rise to an ethical level of civic engagement.

In this paper we\ninvestigate the importance of research infrastructures for arts and humanities\nresearch. We seek to outline the development of a digital research infrastruc-\nture localised in the science and engineering domain and framed within the\nconcept of e-Science. We define the primary characteristics of e-Science as big\ndata and big structures such as the grid and high performance computing.

At that time, in keep-\ning with its etymology, a technology was a branch of learning, or\ndiscourse, or treatise concerned with the mechanic arts. (Marx\n2010)\n\nFor this paper we have been asked to champion ‘big structures’ as the most\nsuitable technical template for research infrastructures as opposed to ‘light-\nweight web’ technology. The immediate problem presented is to understand\nwhat is meant by ‘technical template’ in this context. Contemporary discourse\nabout technology frequently treats it as a ‘thing’ ~ it is a device, a piece of\nhardware, or it is a software component or an application — it is, as Marx ar-\ngues, “the material component” of the infrastructure. This narrow prism serves\nto distance technology from the social, economic, political and epistemic rela-\n\n* Address all communications to: Sheila Anderson, Centre for e-Research, 26-29 Drury Lane,\nRoom 301, King’s College London, London WC2B 5RL, UK;\ne-mail: sheila.anderson@kcl.ac.uk.\nTobias Blanke, Centre for e-Research, 26-29 Drury Lane, Room 223, King’s College\nLondon, London WC2B 5RL, UK; tobias. blanke @kcl.ac.uk.\n\n \n\nHistorical Social Research, Vol. 37 —- 2012 —- No. 3, 147-164\n\f"

For this paper therefore, we\nshall attempt to reclaim the original meaning of technology and to frame our\nargument as a ‘discourse concerned with the mechanic arts’ where the me-\nchanic arts in this context are the digital research infrastructures and techno-\nlogical structures that enable and support humanities research work.\n\nIn this paper we look first to set our discussion in its historical context refer-\nencing works on the history of large technology systems. We then seek to out-\nline the development of a digital research infrastructure localised in the science\nand engineering domain and framed within the concept of e-Science. We define\nthe primary characteristics of e-Science as big data and big structures such as\nthe grid and high performance computing. We will attempt to demonstrate the\ntransfer of the e-Science paradigm to the humanities and to assess what worked\nand what did not. We then suggest how thinking about technology and infra-\nstructure through and within the humanities can lead to transformation and\ninnovation and enable us to re-think research infrastructure around the prob-\nlems that humanities scholars are confronting as they interact with the emerg-\ning research infrastructure environments. We finish with a suggestion that the\nfuture for humanities research infrastructures is best framed around the emerg-\ning idea of a humanities specific digital ecosystem.\n\nHistorical Context: Large Technology Systems\n\nThomas Hughes has written extensively on the history of ‘large technology\nsystems’ (LTS) (Hughes 1986, 1993). Hughes started his work by investigating\nthe growth of electric light and power systems questioning “how the small,\nintercity lighting systems of the 1880s evolved into the regional power systems\nof the 1920s” (Hughes 1986). He was interested in why growth occurred in\nsome cases and failure in others and for this he looked not just at the techno-\nlogical issues but also at the wider context in which these systems developed —\nthe social, political, legal and other elements that acted alongside the techno!-\nogy as drivers of growth or causes of failure. He concluded that the key factor\nwas interactivity and argued that the history of technology could be written\nonly by taking a systems approach that considered the whole and not just the\ntechnological part. It was the interaction between the component parts (human,\ntechnological, social etc.) that was the real force behind the shape of the emerg-\ning systems and their growth or failure.\n\nHughes defined complex systems as “coherent structures comprised of in-\nteracting, interconnected components that ranged from relatively simple\nmechanisms to regional power electric supply networks” (Hughes 1993). Evo-\nlution of LTS was characterised by disruption, intervention, competition, and\ncould result in failure, as well as success. The conceptual model for LTS sug-\n\n148\n\f"

As others seek solutions to similar problems tech-\nnology transfer occurs, for example, electricity systems are transferred and\ntaken up in other cities or countries, or technologies are transferred from one\ndomain to another. It is at this stage that both innovation and disruption are\nmost likely to occur. Those drawing on existing technologies and systems are\nlikely to have divergent practices and requirements that are particular to the\nsocial, cultural, political and financial conditions under which they operate and\nthe act of transfer inevitably leads to change, adaption, and competition; new\ninnovations are likely but so are competing and incompatible systems.\n\nMaturing systems move to a consolidation stage where one of two scenarios\nis reached: the emergence of a single dominant system, or a set of interoper-\nating systems that can form networks such as the power grid or the railway\nsystem. The end result is the establishment of a service that is ubiquitous and\ntaken for granted. In reality consolidation into a single dominant structure is\nrare and more often the result is a decentralised network characterised by coor-\ndination rather than control. Others (Callon 1986, Edwards 1998) have argued\nthat a networks model better captures the state of continuous interactivity,\ntesting, and innovation that occurs. The model of historical LTS development\nhas arisen from an analysis of numerous cases from the 19th century onwards\nand we wish to argue that we can use it to help us to understand the trajectory\nof digital infrastructure development. Understanding this model and seeking to\napply it to our thinking about the development of digital humanities research\ninfrastructures and the technologies that we may wish to include can help to\nprovide a framework in which we can reflect, question, and analyse their evolu-\ntion.\n\nA Universe of Digital Content\n\nA Special Report on ‘Managing Information’ in the February 2010 online\nedition of The Economist' argues that information has gone from scarce to\nsuperabundant citing studies that estimate the amount of data now being gener-\nated at between 5 Exabyte’s and 1,200 Exabyte’s per annum. The disparity in\nthese two figures is a function of the calculations used ~ the lower figure ex-\npresses only new content, whilst the latter includes projections for multiple\nduplications of digital content. Whichever figure is used the increase in digital\ndata is astonishing. A significant proportion of this data is research data gener-\nated from scientific instruments, including giant telescopes, sensors, and per-\nhaps best known, the Large Hadron Collider, or biological reference databases\n\n'  chttp://www.economist.com/node//15557443/>.\n\n149\n\f"

It would not be too far-fetched\nto argue that the availability of this data for processing and analysis is trans-\nforming scientific understanding, leading to new discoveries, and raising im-\nportant new research questions about our universe and human life. Similarly, in\naddition to the more traditional survey and qualitative data, social scientists are\nincreasingly turning to data generated by social media sites, retail and business\ntransactions as the source material for their research leading to new kinds of\nsocial and economic research and methods such as webometrics (Thelwall\n2009).\n\nBy contrast the humanities do not, and are unlikely to produce large vol-\numes of digital data equivalent to the Large Hadron Collider. Instead humani-\nties research data tends to be highly fragmented across scholarly online publi-\ncations, smaller web sites and larger repositories in libraries, archives,\nmuseums, galleries, publishers and the commercial sector. Neither have the\nhumanities managed to get the support to produce and sustain reference data-\nsets (Perseus being one such example from the humanities) such as that pro-\nvided by the legislation that established the National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation (NCBD) as a division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM)\nat the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to host and support the Genome. But\ndespite these differences in scale, there is a significant and growing corpus of\ndigital content available for scholarly research: digital content initiatives such\nas Europeana’ are opening up access to the mass of digital objects created by\ncultural heritage institutions across Europe; the Library of Congress American\nMemory programme provides free and open access through the Internet to\nwritten and spoken words, sound recordings, still and moving images, prints,\nmaps, and sheet music that document the American experience; there are nu-\nmerous digitisation programmes funded at national level such as the JISC dig-\nitisation programme in the UK? or the TELDAP* programme in Taiwan, and\nmany more smaller scale digital library, digital archive and digital scholarly\npublications that together form a significant resource for research across the\nhumanities disciplines. A good argument might also be made that much of the\ncontent on the web and that generated by social media are also of value for\nunderstanding humanity.\n\nMore worrying than the volume of digital content is the creeping move to-\nwards the commodification of content, locking down behind pay walls the\n\n<http://www.europeana.eu/portal/>.\n<http://www jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/topics/digitisation.aspx>.\n<http:/Aeldap.tw/en/>.\n\nbow\n\n150\n\f"

            "result": "digital content that should form a key resource for humanities scholarship\n(Prescott 2012). For example, the British Library has partnered with a commer-\ncial company to digitise their newspaper archives locking the content away\nbehind a pay wall, and Chadwyck Healey’s Early English Books Online is only\navailable for scholarly use through an institutional subscription, and even then\nmost of the content is in PDF form. A frequently-quoted example of a large-\nscale digitisation effort that falls short of scholarly standards is Google’s at-\ntempt to scan and make available Tristram Shandy (Duguid 2007). Whole\npages were left out because they were considered to be misprints even though\nthey were part of the original composition of the novel because Google did not\nconsider it necessary to ask for more input from researchers and scholars in the\nfield. These problems with quality and format limit the ability of the scholar to\ndo much more than find and read, thus reducing her to the role of passive con-\nsumer and restricting opportunities for innovation and the application of com-\nputational methods and tools.\n\nThis creeping commercialisation of the digital life blood of the humanities\nseems to attract little opposition or protest; compared to the sciences where the\nfight for open data is highly vocal and ongoing (Editorial, Nature Genetics,\n2012) the humanities barely raise a murmur as the commercial sector hides\naway digital sources behind pay walls, or strips away their options for new\nforms of research by virtue of providing low quality digital content in inappro-\npriate formats. What might the reasons for this be? In comparison to the sci-\nences and the social sciences, the humanities have yet to experiment to any\nmeaningful extent with the transformative potential of large volumes of digital\ncontent and the application of new methods, nor have they identified the new\nresearch questions that might result from such experimentation. Humanists,\neven those who consider themselves of the digital persuasion, tend to be con-\nservative in their application of technology and seemingly unwilling, except in\na few exceptional cases, to put their heads above the parapet and explore and\ndefend different forms of research practice. And even where the digital hu-\nmanities has experimented with new ideas and the application of digital meth-\nods it has, by and large, failed to penetrate mainstream humanities scholarship\nto any substantial extent (Juola 2008, Prescott 2012). Even worse, the digital\nhumanities and those working within it are too often seen as “... a production\nhouse, a place where the infrastructural work of digitization, marking-up texts,\nand producing tools to facilitate research gets done” (Trettien 2010) rather than\nas a space and a community which takes up the political and cultural mantle to\nprotect the right of humanities scholars to their sources materials, and where\nexperimentation evolves into new ideas, questions, and theories.\n\nConfronted with the triple challenge of increasing volumes of digital con-\ntent, some of which is locked away or inadequate for scholarly research; the\nfailure of the digital humanities to fight to keep their content open; and the\nperceived failure of the digital humanities to fulfil the promise of transforming\n\n151\n\f"

(Bowker 2010)\nThe term e-Science was created in 1999 by John Taylor, the then Director\nGeneral of the United Kingdom’s Office of Science and Technology. Taylor\nsaw that many areas of science were increasingly collaborative, multidiscipli-\nnary, and working with and sharing large data volumes. What was required,\nTaylor argued, was a funding programme to support these new forms of re-\nsearch, including the necessary infrastructure components ~ the UK e-Science\nprogramme was born. Launched in 2001 the programme was intended to sup-\nport both the development of a coordinated, shared, core infrastructure and the\napplication of e-Science methods to research. The e-Science programme was\nlargely technology, data and application driven assuming that the “enormous\nand growing capacity of computing, storage, communication and software\nsystems - offered the opportunity not only to automate science but also to\napply new methods that could revolutionise how science was performed” (At-\nkins et al. 2009). In this context research was done “through distributed global\ncollaborations enabled by the internet, using very large data collections, terra-\nscale computing resources and high performance visualisation” (Atkins et al.\n2009).\n\nThe core infrastructure that arose from the e-Science programme was made\nup of a number of elements and technologies including data (and the curation\nand preservation activities that supported its creation, use, re-use and sustain-\nability); compute network and data storage; search and navigation tools; virtual\nresearch environments; and software solutions for authorisation and authentica-\ntion, middleware, and digital rights management (Pothen 2007). Key technolo-\ngies included the Grid which according to Hey and Trefethan is “the infrastruc-\nture which will provide us with the ability to dynamically link together\nresources as an ensemble to support the execution of large-scale, resource\nintensive, and distributed applications” (Hey and Trefethan 2003). As the Grid\nhas matured a number of standard technologies and web-services have emerged\nto support the deployment and use of the Grid.\n\n152\n\f"

Interestingly the Chair of the Com-\nmission, John Unsworth, borrowed the definition of Cyberinfrastructure from\nthe 2003 NSF report:\n\nThe 2003 National Science Foundation report Revolutionizing Science and\nEngineering through Cyberinfrastructure ... described Cyberinfrastructure as a\n‘layer of enabling hardware, algorithms, software, communications, institu-\ntions, and personnel’ that lies between a layer of ‘base technologies ... the in-\ntegrated electro-optical components of computation, storage, and communica-\ntion’ and a layer of ‘software programs, services, instruments, data, infor-\nmation, knowledge, and social practices applicable to specific projects,\ndisciplines, and communities of practice.” In other words, for the Atkins report\n(and for this one), Cyberinfrastructure is more than a tangible network and\nmeans of storage in digitized form, and it is not only discipline-specific soft-\nware applications and project-specific data collections. It is also the more in-\ntangible layer of expertise and the best practices, standards, tools, collections\nand collaborative environments that can be broadly shared across communities\nof inquiry. (Unsworth, Our Cultural Commonwealth 2006)\n\n \n\n \n\n2006 also saw the publication, subsequently updated in 2010, of the European\nStrategy Forum on Research Infrastructures Roadmap with a very similar defi-\nnition.\n\nAll of these definitions identify the key characteristics as a mix of hardware,\nsoftware, instrumentation, digital content, data, and archives, together with\nhuman resources, knowledge and expertise that are to be shared among com-\nmunities of practice, and that are essentially collaborative in nature and form.\nAt their core is the idea of collaboration and sharing between and across com-\nmunities ~ whether sharing research data, compute power or other resources ~\nin order to enable new forms of enquiry, and the generation and understanding\nof new research questions. This idea of an infrastructure based on sharing in the\nscientific community was at the heart of the various international e-Science\nprogrammes.\n\nThe attempts to build science Grids have recently evolved into developing\nopen science Clouds. Hey defines the Cloud as “... the ecosystem of technolo-\ngies that enable the hosting of an organisation's or individual’s ICT infrastruc-\nture (hardware and software) in large data centres managed by service provid-\ners” (Hey 2010). Clouds are also used to store, manage and analyse digital\ncontent, including curation and preservation services, and to host advanced\nservices for data analysis, data indexing, metadata extraction and so on.

Researchers will just plug in to a Cloud,\nwhich will provide storage or computation on demand. Cloud Computing is\npart of the larger domain of Utility Computing and if more resources are\nneeded they are available at the click of a button.\n\nBut despite Unsworth’s use of the National Science Foundation Cyberinfra-\nstructure definition how applicable is the e-Science paradigm to the humani-\nties? Whilst a case can be made that the humanities has its own data (digital\ncontent) deluge which is compounded by the ‘complexity deluge’ (Anderson et\nal. 2010) inherent in the highly dispersed, multiple format, multiple media, and\noften highly idiosyncratic nature of the digital content, the common conception\nof humanities research work is that it is hermeneutic rather than experimental,\nrooted in narrative, rhetoric and text; that it does not seek formal laws and\nexplanations but rather is essentially interpretive, recursive and questioning, its\npractices located in the deep reading and reasoning of sources. This conception\nof humanities research work is poetically described by Andrew Prescott who,\nin his inaugural lecture at King’s College London in 2012, claimed that “scien-\ntists want to map the Universe; humanities scholars want to map the universe in\na single poem”.’ The single poem does not require ‘big data’ methods.\n\nThis debate is not new. Writing in 1993 Mark Olsen argued that the reason\ncomputer aided literature studies had failed to have a significant impact on the\nfield was because they asked only traditional questions of traditional texts and\nso:\n\n... have failed to move from a curiosity to an important and respected position\n\nin these disciplines. By contrast, quantitative social, political and economic\n\nhistory used computer technology to ask new questions and to develop new\nmethods. Indeed, the computer fits nicely into a shift away from political and\nevent based history, to the history of the social phenomena and the long term,\n\nla longue durée. (Olsen 1993)\n\nThe problem, Olsen suggests, is the failure to critically engage with theory and\nto locate the use of technology and data selection in a theoretical framework\nthat would encourage “research design that exploits the strongest points of\ncomputer technology, the high speed access and analysis of large amounts of\ndata” (Olsen 1993).\n\nIn 2005 Franco Moretti threw out a similar challenge to literary scholars in-\nviting them to look beyond the smail (around two hundred he suggested) num-\nber of literary works that most scholars work on throughout their lifetimes to\nconsider the vast number of published works within which this literary canon\nsits. He argued that traditional methods of ‘close reading’ where the focus is on\n‘this word and this sentence’ was stifling an understanding of the ‘collective\nsystem’ that is the universe of literature: “... a field this large cannot be under-\n\n> Available at <http://digitalriffs .blogspot.co.uk/>.\n\n154\n\f"

He called\nthis approach ‘distant reading’.\n\nOlsen and Moretti both make a compelling case for the use of ‘big’ data and\nquantitative and graphical methods of exploration and analysis. As we have\nargued above the humanities now have at their disposal significant quantities of\ndigital information but for that big technological structures are required.\n\nTransferring: e-Science Infrastructures and the Humanities\n\nRole for arts and humanities: Encourage and support even more\nparticipation of the arts and humanities research communities in the\ne-Science Programme (we saw some excellent beginnings in our re-\nview). Arts and humanities are poised to achieve large benefit from\ne-science methods and infrastructure as the human record becomes\nincreasingly digitised and multimedia. (Recommendations, e-Scien-\nce Review 2009)\nFunded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), the Engineer-\ning and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and the Joint Informa-\ntion Systems Committee (JISC), and managed by the AHRC ICT in Research\nProgramme, the UK Arts and Humanities e-Science programme? investigated\nthe transfer and use of large e-Science structures for arts and humanities re-\nsearch. At the beginning, it seemed likely that the use of these technologies\nwould be mainly for the processing and integration of different types of hu-\nmanities content. However, it soon became clear that the challenges of the\nunderlying semantics made it very difficult to sensibly use the then existing e-\nScience technologies in the field (Blanke 2011); rather it was high-performance\ncomputing and the application of data analytics that proved a better fit to en-\nhance humanities research.\n\nThe UK Arts and Humanities e-Science programme awarded grants to un-\ndertake humanities research using large e-Science structures and technologies.\nThe projects covered a wide range of subjects in both the arts and the humani-\nties, from dance and music to museum studies, archaeology, classics and Byz-\nantine history, and employed a wide range of e-Science technologies.\n\nFor example, the e-Dance project’ used Access Grid video conferencing\ntechnologies, motion tracking and other digital tools to facilitate interactive,\nmultimedia, distributed performance, staged in more than one venue and em-\nploying a variety of traditional and digital means of expression.

Rather, we need to consider the complex\nchallenges from the processing of big data in such a way that humans can make\nsense of it, and the nature of the trust collaborations and understandings that\nwill be essential to our work.\n\nWe are at the very beginning of understanding what a humanities research\ninfrastructure is and could be, and what technologies are best suited for sup-\nporting and enhancing our research practices and processes. We may be\nminded therefore, to ask wider questions of the relationship of humanities\ncommunities to the digital space and to the big structures within it: what are the\ntensions and contested areas that are emerging as infrastructure becomes digital\nand scholars increasingly engage with big data questions and methods? What\ndoes it mean for humanities research practices, for the relationships and col-\nlaborations, and the norms, values and accepted conventions that bind indi-\nviduals together in shared communities of practice? What is to be gained from\nworking with and through these new research infrastructures and equally im-\nportant, what might be lost?\n\nThe Digging into Data Challenge research programme was established to\naddress how “big data” changes the research landscape for the humanities and\nsocial sciences now that large volumes of digital content are available to schol-\nars in the humanities and social sciences, and what new, computationally based\nresearch methods might be applied.” Dan Cohen, Tim Hitchcock and Geoffrey\nRockwell received funding under the 2009 call for proposals to bring together\nthree online resources: the Old Bailey Online, Zotero and TAPoR to experi-\nment with the application of data mining and statistical analysis to a large cor-\npus of complex texts and information (127 million words of trial accounts)\nusing analytical tools from TAPoR like Voyeur, information management tools\nlike Zotero, and the Canadian HPC facilities. The project has resulted in an\ninfrastructure that allows users to engage with the Old Bailey Online using\nthese tools”.\n\nThe White Paper (Cohen et al. 2011) written by the project team demon-\nstrates the success of the approach and provides examples of new insights into\nthe data produced by the application of data analytical techniques and tools.\nClearly the use of ‘big data’ techniques and tools (and the use of high perform-\nance computing) has added a layer of understanding, new questions, and inter-\nesting insights that would not be possible for humans alone to achieve.

As a consequence many are wary about engaging with what is\nseen as a scientific paradigm based on reason and objectivity that runs counter\nto the epistemology of the humanities. The solution, Drucker argues, is to re-\ngard machine algorithms and the visual forms produced from big data analysis\nas interpretive objects in and of themselves, to think of them as visual signs on\na flat surface that require the application of the hermeneutic method so that\n“the forms that are generally used for the presentation of information can be\nunderstood and read as culturally coded expressions of knowledge with their\nown epistemological assumptions and historical lineage” (Drucker 2010). This\nbringing to bear of a humanities sensibility - to create meaning from the pat-\nterns, to interpret the algorithms, and to foreground the complexity and uncer-\ntainty to be found in the visual expressions arising from big data analysis — can\nsurely serve to entwine big data methods and outputs with the more familiar\nmethods and outputs from hermeneutic enquiry.\n\nBig data and the big structures required to use it are, we would argue, a key\nelement of digital scholarship and should take their rightful place in the evolu-\ntion of humanities research infrastructures, but only as long as we remain\nmindful at all times of the particularities of humanities research (and the differ-\nences between humanities disciplines) and seek to question our assumptions\nand practices.

The Move to Digital Eco-Systems\n\nDigital Ecosystems transcend the traditional, rigorously defined,\ncollaborative environments from centralised, distributed or hybrid\nmodels into an open, flexible, domain cluster, demand-driven, inter-\nactive environment. (Boley and Chang 2007)\nThe metaphor of the digital ecosystem is taken from the biological world in\norder to explain the intrinsic interaction between communities and computing\nplatforms. A natural environment consists of ecosystems, which in turn have\nhabitats and communities inhabiting them. The biological derivation of digital\necosystem, however, only takes us so far. As with many concepts in comput-\ning, the uses of the concept determine better what it is about. Here, digital\necosystems are an emerging new concept of infrastructures that recognises the\nneed for a flexible combination of humans, machines, content and things to\nwork together on a common task.

As open systems, digital research ecosystems will rely on\ncommunities and community involvement in a scenario where anyone can\nparticipate. The digital ecosystem is not for the specialist few but is instead\nabout increased participation, sharing and building a social network of people,\nthings, content and so on. Here is where the original comparison with biologi-\ncal ecosystems makes sense. Looking at the relationship between components\nof the digital ecosystem and the biological ecosystem in Figure 1 (taken from\nBriscoe et al. 2011), we can easily map communities in the biological ecosys-\ntem to domain research crowds while the biological habitats are the digital\nplatforms our research crowds work on.

Research\ncommunities can then build their own views on these data sets and accumulate\nthem for their research ‘niches’. The Holocaust research community is not\nhomogeneous but split up into divergent research; research into victims’ mate-\nrials or testimonials stands next to more traditional archival research into per-\npetrators.

The Digital Turn in Textual Scholarship\nHistorical and Typological Perspectives\n\nODD EINAR HAUGEN AND DANIEL APOLLON\n\nThree Perspectives\n\nThis chapter is written under the assumption that the history of textual scholar-\nship from its very beginnings to the digital age can be understood from three\nperspectives. These perspectives are not the perspectives of the historian who\ntries to grasp the development of textual scholarship, but rather the perspectives\nheld by the practitioners of the art and science of editing texts, for scholars who\nedit, comment, and analyze texts written by other people. This chapter assumes\nthat editors may choose to look backward, outward, or inward.\n\nFirst, looking backward means to search for the origin of the text and to\ntrace its development through time. When dealing with classical and medieval\nworks, the editor has to track the process of copying, starting with the original\ntext and then moving on from one copy to the next. When dealing with post-\nGutenberg texts, the editor needs to trace the development from the first drafts\nmade by the author until the end product, usually a printed edition. Second,\nlooking outward means to view the text as a product situated in a sociohistori-\ncal context. This implies that its contents, its use, and its organic relationship\nto other texts and sociocultural realities is of greater interest than its origin\nand material transmission. Third, looking inward implies viewing the text as\nan individual expression of its own right, as a self-contained document, to be\nread and understood on its intrinsic merits. One of the characteristics of texts\nand literature, highlighted by the New Criticism in literary studies in the 1950s,\nis the existence of multiple layers of meaning and of a wealth of interpretations.\n\nThe approach defended in this chapter reflects the belief that the self-con-\ntained nature of texts, as advocated by this New Criticism (looking inward),\nand the awareness of the organic relationship of texts to their world (looking\n\f"

The purpose of this chapter is to show how these three\nperspectives may shape digital text scholarship.\n\nThe tripartite view outlined above is, of course, a simplification, and it is\nnot intended to be a scheme in a Hegelian sense for the actual history and\ndevelopment of textual scholarship. It includes, rather, three aspects that have\nbeen differently weighted in the practice of textual scholars over the years, to\nthe extent that these perspectives can be seen as competing but not mutually\nexclusive points of orientation. Any scholar who primarily looks toward the\norigin ofa text and tries to chart its development will understand and acknowl-\nedge the fact that each stage of the text also has a contemporaneous setting and\ninterpretation and will indeed exploit such contextual knowledge. Any scholar\nfocusing on the setting of a text, on its Sitz im Leben (German: literally, its “set-\nting in life”), or its uses is well aware that the text also has a material history\nand a physical aspect!\n\nThis chapter takes a broad look at the history of textual scholarship with these\nperspectives in mind. While the history of textual scholarship is commonly\ntraced back to the birth of Western philology in the Hellenistic age, shaped and\ncultivated in the Library of Alexandria, the starting point here is the method-\nological foundation of textual scholarship in the early nineteenth century. This\ndoes not mean that the long history of textual scholarship in antiquity, in the\nMiddle Ages, or indeed in early modern times should be disregarded as “pre-\nscientific.” but that major approaches to textual scholarship, in print and online,\ncan be exemplified and discussed with reference to scholars of the nineteenth\nand twentieth centuries.\n\nLooking Backward: The Formalist Approach\n\nThe conception of modern textual criticism is commonly thought of as belonging\nto Karl Lachmann (1793-1851) and his generation of editors in the first half of the\nnineteenth century. Lachmann’s work covered all three major fields of editorial\nphilology—classical philology, Bible philology, and medieval philology—and\nthus has become a point of reference in all of these fields. Lachmann expressed\nclearly the basic tenets of a scientific textual criticism very early in his career\nin a critical review published in 1817 of Friedrich von der Hagen’s edition of\nDer Nibelungen Lied (1816). Lachmann claimed that the editor should search\nfor the original version of the text, or, if that was unattainable, for as close an\napproximation to the original as possible: “On the basis of a sufficient number\nof good manuscripts, we should and we must build a text which reflects all of\nthese, a text which either would be the original text or a text which would come\nvery close to the original”?

In vernacular\nmedieval literature, texts were often copied quite freely, blurring the distinction\nbetween the copyist and the redactor. In short, the genealogical method remains\na valid method, but only for a minority of manuscript traditions. There is no\nsuch thing as a “genetic tracer,’ any textual equivalent of mitochondrial DNA,\nthat may help the editor and readers to irrefutably identify an original text.\n\nWhat a mathematical analysis can offer is a way of mapping the distribution\nof variants of a text. While this has been envisaged for a long time (see, for ex-\nample, the bold statement by Henri Quentin quoted above), it is only in the last\ndecades that this has been made possible in practice. Mathematical models do\nhave their limitations, however. They can undoubtedly help the critic to establish\na focal text, in the sense that they can identify clusters of variants and thus the\nlikely centers in the transmission of the text. It is less certain that they can help\nin establishing an archetypical text—that is, a text in which the diachronic axis\nhas been revealed, and thus showing which variants belong to an earlier stage\nof the text and which belong to a later stage.’\n\nRather than dethroning the editor, early computer-assisted textual criticism\nhas confirmed his or her central position, adding tools and enlarging his or her\ndecision space. Given the wide array of document-encoding tools and standards\navailable nowadays, as described elsewhere in this book, and the general avail-\nability of presentational tools and easy access to online publication, the digital\ntext scholar may choose to offer all elements of the inward perspective to a wide\narray of readers and users.\n\nLooking Outward: The Ecology of Texts\n\n \n\ne backward-looking perspective described in the section above endeavors\n‘o establish a text that is as irrefutably as possible and as close as possible to an\noriginal prototype. Only to the extent it is deemed necessary and only when\nmaterial criteria are not available are external aspects taken into consideration.\nerefore, exploiting external aspects, such as sociocultural, psychological, or\ninstitutional knowledge, occurs mainly on a case-by-case basis. And indeed\nwhen such external aspects are exploited by the textual critic, the genealogical\nmethod practiced does not encourage the critic to fully integrate these aspects\nand exploit some kind of overarching theory about the relationship between\nthe text and its environment.\n\nThe first turn from an exclusively backward-looking perspective toward an\noutward-looking perspective exploits the awareness that a text or document is\nauthored or at least put together by a human compiler or editor with a particular\nintention. One assumes that the originator of such a text exhibits a minimum of\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\f"

Indeed, it may be useful to adopt a less principled\napproach to the material original of texts and to rehabilitate the contemporary\nsettings of all manuscripts in order to see their details more clearly. Hence, dis-\nregarding the filiation of the manuscript can indeed constitute a valid procedure\nas an interim act of focusing on the totality of a text tradition as we know it.\n\nHowever, empirical facts are difficult to refute, even if they are inconvenient.\nNo one will dispute that manuscripts have been copied from one another, and at\nthe end of the line there is an original, a first version of the text as it has unfolded\nthrough the filiation. In almost all classical and early medieval text traditions,\nthe original has been irrevocably lost. What remains are later copies, distant by\nseveral centuries and stages of copy from the original. The scholarly editor has\nto deal with traditions where a majority of the once existing manuscripts have\nbeen lost through damage, neglect, fire, shipwrecks (many saga manuscripts\nwere lost on the perilous sea voyage between Iceland and Norway, for example),\nthrough the auto-da-fé of Jewish and Islamic manuscripts of the Spanish Inqui-\nsition, during the Wars of Religion, or through the widespread destruction of\npapist literature during the Reformation. For this reason, not only the original\nbuta major part of the whole manuscript tradition as well may have disappeared\nforever. Only an educated approximation of the original is possible, based on\nan analysis of the earliest surviving textual witnesses. This is the concept of the\narchetype, as defined by Paul Maas in his austere “Textkritik” (1927 and later\neditions). The archetype, to avoid misunderstanding, is not a physical source but,\nrather, a theoretical concept, and as such it is not prone to any death, but is no\nfinal proof of the existence of an original and is not irrefutable. The archetype\nsimply reflects the labors of reconstructive efforts made by textual critics. As a\nconcept it is strictly neutral. The text of the archetype is not a priori “better” than\nthat of later manuscripts; it is at best one of the least refutable hypotheses of the\noriginal state of the text. Only when the original reading of a text is deemed to\nbe of higher value than secondary readings can the archetypical text be said to\nbe the better text.\n\nAlthough new philologists have succeeded to a certain degree in reconcil-\ning the material witnesses of a text tradition with their historical environment,\nthey may have introduced a problematic relativism. if all manuscripts (or any\nmaterial source, physical or digital, for that matter) are regarded only on their\nintrinsic values, their genealogical links will be severed. It will then no longer\nbe possible to assign a given manuscript a precise position its own genetic his-\ntory. Such mapping can only be done using a diachronic approach, by looking\nbackward, however faulty the results of the genealogical or similar methods may\nbe. As a consequence, the new philology may eventually fall into the same kind\nof extreme posture as the pure synchronic analysis of a linguistic stage, which\n\n   \n\f"

In geology or evolutionary genetics, such simplifications would\namount to failures.\n\nThere are also highly pragmatic reasons for looking backward. Some texts\nhave been copied in very large numbers. In a wealth of manuscripts it is a\npressing question to know where a particular manuscript is situated within its\ntradition. Does it belong to a representative core, retaining most of the presumed\noriginal readings? Is it peripheral, typical of only an era or a geographic locale?\nIs it an Einzelgénger, a loner, with few or no immediate relatives?\n\nUnless new philology intends to evolve into a pure idiographic science, it\nneeds to reflect and take into consideration the diachronic axis ofa manuscript\ntradition. This is why, in our opinion, there should be no opposition between\nthe diachronic approach of the “old” philologists and the synchronic approach\nof the “new” philologists. It is a matter of perspective and of priority.\n\nThe Resilience of a Two-Dimensional Spatial View\n\nThe introduction of printing by movable type in the fifteenth century is often\nseen as a revolution and a main turning point in human history. However, look-\ning at textual scholarship, and especially at textual editing, the most outstanding\ntrait of early printed books is the close mimicking of manuscript codices of\nthe day. Johannes Gutenberg’s Bible looks like a well-executed manuscript in\nits overall design of pages with two columns, in the frequent usage of colored\ninitials, and in the illuminations in the margin. Even the Gothic type was care-\nfully copied from handwritten script.\n\nThe papyrus roll and the codex have two dimensions. The column of the roll\nand the page of the codex define the space for the text, and the margins of the\npage add a separate but not unrelated field for comments, additions, and illumi-\nnations. This geometry has been carried over into the display of digital editions.\nLike Gutenberg in his age, digital editors want to communicate with their users,\nto present their texts in a format that is as familiar as possible. The screen dis-\nplays a two-dimensional image, exactly like the codex and the book. The text is\ncontained within columns and set off with margins. The display in most cases is\noriented toward printouts. Texts of some length are still being read on paper, and\nitis thus practical to make the display on-screen as printer-friendly as possible.\nThe presentation of writing and text, on parchment, paper, or online, relies on\nseveral thousand years of accumulated intellectual technology, a fundamental\nvisual literacy that may be as difficult to eradicate as alphabetic script.\n\nWith the Internet, the World Wide Web, and hypertextual writing space, this\nhas changed.

It seems more likely, however, that online material will\ncontinue to be assimilated into the two-dimensional textual representation. The\nresilience of the two-dimensional spatial model versus the possible adoption by\na large public of more dynamic, nonlinear texts, as well as the emergence of a\nnew literacy will be at the center of debate in the years to come.\n\nThe thrilling fact is that all aspects of scholarly editing and textual criticism\ndiscussed so far—ideologies and methods—are eminently applicable to new\ntexts. Indeed, the contemporary concern for trust, positive identification of\nauthorship, and countermeasure against content falsification on the Internet\nmay draw on the experience of genealogical method and text genetics.\n\nThe Emergence of New Texts\n\nPerhaps the most significant contribution to textual studies of the digital age is\nloss-free copying. The fallible act of copying has indeed been the rationale of\ntextual studies for well over two thousand years. At the time of the Alexandrian\nphilology, the Homeric texts had been handed down over several hundred years\nand, through the process of copying, a number of textual variants had arisen.\nRemoving these errors became one of the first objectives of textual scholarship,\nand this has continued to be of prime importance, especially for what has been\ntermed the formalist approach. Indeed, the genealogical method of Lachmann\nand his contemporaries can be summed up as a method of common errors\n(German: Methode der Fehlergemeinschaften). However, what are erroneous\nreadings in a manuscript from one point of view may be seen as innovations\nfrom another point of view. In a treatise on textual criticism, Martin L. West\npoints out that instead of talking about “errors? he would prefer to talk about\n“readings of secondary origin, thus distancing himself from the most prescrip-\ntive interpretations of the formalist tradition (1973, 323).\n\nThe main, perhaps even exclusive, focus of critical editors is on texts that\nhave been produced and handed down before the modern techniques of loss-\nfree copying. The major divide is still between texts written and filiated in the\nage of the manuscripts and texts written and reproduced after the invention of\nprinting—in other words, a divide between the pre-Gutenberg and the post-\nGutenberg periods. The genealogical method described in this chapter is primar-\nily concerned with the study of manuscript traditions and is of less relevance\nfor printed texts. The editing of printed texts has a different focus, since these\neditions so often have focused on the end product, the Ausgabe letzter Hand (the\nedition of the author's final version), rather than the origins, the Ausgabe erster\nHand (the edition of the author’s first version).

In the age of lead typesetting, new runs of printed books were often\nset anew. In most cases type used for the previous run had been used for new\njobs. Thus, within the story of a printed book, errors were introduced by the\ntypographers. Changes were sometimes made after consultations with the author\nor the publisher (especially if the text contained sensitive matters of religious or\npolitical contents). Other changes were made inadvertently, on the judgment\nof the printer, or after the author's death.\n\nAs suggested above, modern digital texts may change the traditional divide\nbetween pre-Gutenberg and post-Gutenberg editorial philology. First of all,\nloss-free copying has made it impossible to reconstruct the filiation of many\ntexts. Moreover, the life expectancy of many modern digital texts is much shorter\nthan for any printed text. SMS (Short Message Service) messages, Twitter flux,\nICQ (“I Seek You,’ instant messaging) chat logs, to mention a few new textual\nusages, may be deleted a few minutes after they have been received. E-mails,\nblogs, and chats are also living on the margin. A great number of texts simply\nvanish each year, probably to a much higher degree than what has ever been\nthe case for printed texts. The widespread adoption of social media may indeed\nshorten the life cycle of such texts more brutally. The future scholarly editor of\nsuch post-Gutenberg textual traditions may have to resort to the whole armada\nof textual scholarship and invent new ways to deal with short-lived documents.\n\nThe Digital Philology\n\nDigital philology is both a revolution and not a revolution. It has brought new\ntools, efficient data handling, and a wholly modern outlook to philology. Yet\nthe texts studied and edited remain grossly the same, and the questions asked\nby digital philologists do not seem to be qualitatively different from the ques-\ntions asked by pre-digital philologists. Indeed, online editions have been pro-\nduced mainly within the philological paradigm. Surprisingly, projects favoring\nthe intertextuality more than the quest for authenticity and origins, or socio-\ncriticism endeavoring to demonstrate the functional links between content and\nsociocultural realties, have produced few if any online critical projects. What\nremains to be seen is whether digital tools will change the direction of philol-\nogy not so much because of internal preferences but because of the alluring\npossibilities opened up with such tools. It should be added that in many cases\ndigital tools are not new. They are simply more efficient; tools have become so\nfast and fail-proof that investigations that were once too huge to contemplate\nnow have become possible to implement.

Physical\nand digital distribution of books are slowly merging, but not without problems,\nincluding resistance from traditional publishers. Price may be an argument, but\nnot always, at least when it comes to scholarly editions. For scholarly editions on\npaper, prices can be fairly high, especially for gentlemen's editions like Islenzk\nfornrit for Old Norse texts, Henrik Ibsen’s Writings (2006-2009), or the many\nlearned editions of La Pléiade. Digital editions are in their infancy, and pricing\nversus open access is still a question that must be decided.® Some products are\nsimply free (Woolf Online), while others are quite expensive—for instance, the\nCD-ROM of Chaucer's General Prologue (Solopova 2000) costs as much as several\ncloth-bound tomes. As for the dissemination of these products, many editions,\nespecially those containing facsimiles or other large files, are still stored and sold\non solid media such as CD-ROM or DVD (e.g., Wittgenstein’s “Nachlass”: The\nBergen Electronic Edition, published by Oxford University Press [2000], which as of\nOctober 2012 was priced at USs2,500). This means that digital editions are subject\nto the same legal, commercial, and institutional restrictions as printed editions.\n\nDisplay and View: Unresolved Tensions\n\nA printed edition has a single display, typically a single column per page, some-\ntimes with line numbering on alternate pages and a critical apparatus at the\nbottom of the page. Having more than one display means adding wholly new\npages, perhaps another volume, to the edition. This is costly and not done with-\nout good reason. The display of the printed text is sometimes a compromise\nof several options. The editor may wish to display the text at more than one\nlevel—for example, at both a diplomatic level, close to the source, and a regular-\nized level, where the orthography has been adjusted. This is especially helpful\nwhen dealing with vernacular texts in which a detailed rendering is needed for\na linguistic analysis. Representing the text on more than one level in a printed\nedition is usually out of the question, and the editor has to either go for one\nlevel only or resort to an original, complex, and less generally accessible layout\n(e.g., the synoptic editions of the Greek New Testament). Moreover, when a text\nis available in more than one manuscript and the variation between the manu-\nscripts has a bearing on the text, the editor usually uses a critical apparatus to\nrepresent and summarize this variation (see chapter 3 for an in-depth coverage\nof the critical apparatus).\n\n   \n\f"

In fact, digital editors often invest much time in having the edition\nlook “right” This is not necessarily a sign of conservatism or lack of inventive-\nness; it is, rather, to let the text come into the foreground and be displayed\nin a manner that does not draw attention to the digital medium. Awkward\nfonts, wrong margins, and misplaced apparatuses are all examples of a display\nthat goes wrong and turns the attention away from the text. Even if a good\nelectronic display can be very unassuming, it all too often happens that the\nedition has a nonintuitive interface. The digital scholarly editor might be drawn\nbetween the need to preserve and reproduce the original textual look of the\nwork or corpus published online and the need to exploit as much as possible\nthe navigational dynamics of a web-based environment and the various tools\nand viewing mechanisms available.\n\nIf the typical display of a digital edition strives to become a look-alike of a tra-\nditional printed edition, it may underexploit the capacity of the digital medium\nto offer its users alternative views of the same material. There are therefore a\ngreat number of digital editions that offer more than one view of the text. In the\npresent volume, two editions of this type are discussed. The Bergen Electronic\nEdition of Wittgenstein’s Nachlass displays the text on two levels, a diplomatic\njevel and a normalized level, while the Medieval Nordic Text Archive offers three\nlevels, adding a facsimile or record-type level to the diplomatic and normalized\nlevel (see chapter 5).\n\nSearchability: A Constantly Evolving Opportunity\n\nThe alphabetic index is the printed edition’s strong technology.

A good subject index is produced as the result of a thorough analysis of\nthe book's contents.\n\nSimple free text searching may serve as the digital edition’s poor man’s in-\ndex. It can sometimes elicit more information from the text than a standard\nindex. However, to equal the quality of a good index, the digital edition must\nbe marked up with information about its document structure and contents.\nThere are no technical problems with carrying out a thorough markup of a\ntext. The guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) offer a plethora of\nelements to be used, and any new elements can be added thanks to the flexibility\nof XML (Extensible Markup Language) and similar markup schemes.

That was the concordance of the Latin Vulgate Bible by\nHugo de Saint-Cher and a team of no less than five hundred other Dominicans\n(Concordantiae Sacrorum Bibliorum). Until recently, the production of concor-\ndances has been the exacting and manual work of going through a source text\nword by word and linking every running word (perhaps with the exception of the\nmost frequent words, like “and” and “the”) to a headword. The most spectacular\nexample is the lifelong work of Gerhard Lisowsky, Konkordanz zum hebraischen\nAlten Testament (3rd ed., 1958). Getting the context for a particular word required\nleafing through the edition and inspecting visually every word. The Key Word\nin Context (KWIC) concordances were one of the first offers of digital text\ntools, and their effectiveness has rendered printed concordances obsolete, or if\nconcordances still are printed, they can be produced from a digital text.\n\nUntil recently, digital search tools offered only simple lexical searches, en-\nhanced by technologies such as regular expressions, allowing users to combine\nseveral searches in a single instruction. Recent advances in conceptual modeling,\npropelled by the vision of the Semantic Web,” have opened new avenues for\nconceptual search, as illustrated by computer ontologies, topic maps, and tools\nlike WordNet.” However, no method can replace the fundamental contribution\nof the scholarly editor.\n\nAnalyzability: An Evolving Possibility\n\nIn addition to search tools and concordances, digital editions may offer new\ntools that blur the frontier between pure presentation and viewing on the one\nhand and analysis and knowledge production on the other. Some online editions\nhave evolved by gradually integrating more functions, tools, and views. The\nexplorative editions of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales by Peter Robinson and his\ncolleagues are a case in point. The CD-ROM edition of The Wife of Bath’s Pro-\nlogue initially contained diplomatic transcriptions of all manuscripts containing\nthe prologue as well as digital images of them (Robinson 1996). However, at this\nstage of the project there was no critical text. Establishing the text was left to the\nacademic readers.

The user can then piece together the text for him- or herself\nand add annotations, emendations, or even conjectures. One person’s edition\ncan thus become different from another person's edition. The Bergen Electronic\nEdition of Wittgenstein’s Nachlass has already seen this happen. A digital edi-\ntion has the potential of being an edifio continua, no longer constrained by the\neditors, as argued by Alois Pichler and Odd Einar Haugen (2005). Some have\ncommented positively on this; others have been more skeptical. What is not a\nmatter of controversy is that digital texts are much more difficult to constrain\nthan printed texts. It remains to be seen if the tension between experts (the\nanalyst, the editor) and the users of the edition (experts and nonexperts) will\ngenerate higher-quality products. Although user annotation is fully realizable\ntechnologically and has been mainstreamed in social media, one may still ask\nwhether the resources between experts and readers are still unevenly distributed.\nWhile many academics bash Wikipedia for its unreliability, the considerable\nsuccess of the project across many languages and cultures should augur a new\nera for user-annotated digital editions.\n\nNew Tools, Old Directions?\n\nThe view taken in this chapter is that the digital revolution essentially is the\nintroduction of more efficient tools. It is not the introduction of new scien-\ntific methods or critical ideologies. It is not the introduction of new points of\nview. In fact, the first stage of the digital revolution, before the wide adoption\nof social media and the relative victory of the user-sharing ideology over the\ncentralized content-production ideology, was very similar to the introduction\nof printing by movable type half a millennium earlier. That was a brand-new\ntool that suddenly made it possible to produce books in large quantities and\nthus spread knowledge to a much larger section of society. The contents of the\nbook, however, were not new. The design was a true copy of the time-honored\ncodex. The main agent of change today, allowing digital media to convey new\nmodes of productions and possibly initiate a new kind of literacy, may turn\nout to be online collaborative media where the roles of producer, diffuser and\nconsumer tends to merge (see, e.g., Bruns 2005).\n\nReturning to the three perspectives outlined at the outset of this article, they\nall seem to be neutral with respect to digital technologies.

There are new and more efficient tools for\ninvestigating the filiation of a text, but the rationale for doing so (to repeat our\nclaim once more) lies beyond the technology. Looking outward is as important\nas ever, and the methods are sometimes identical to those used for diachronic\nstudies. Advances in display will also be important for the actual dissemination\nof texts; the facsimile edition and the text edition can close ranks and become\ncheaper and more available. And those who prefer to look inward, toward the\nstructure of the text itself, will find many digital tools heipful, such as concor-\ndance tools, markup schemes, and methods for pattern recognition.\n\nThe outcome of this discussion is a healthy skepticism toward messianic\nprophecies for the digital age. Textual scholarship has a long history, and it\nwill not change overnight with advances in digital technology. However, new\ntechnology may lead to the development of new methods, and it will most likely\nlead to a change of priorities. One early example in the brief history of digital\nphilology is the idea that the editor should present the whole material and then,\nalmost in a positivist manner, take a long step backward, leaving the choice to\nthe users. I am not the keeper of the text. Make your own edition!\n\nHowever, such a position, as democratic as it may seem, may be a step in\nthe wrong direction. The editor should not succumb to the temptation of the\nunlimited helpfulness of the digital medium. Presenting the material in its\nwealth is so temptingly easy. And it is the accessibility of this option that may\nlead the editor or expert to forget that editorial judgment is still what the edi-\ntor has to offer, no matter what tools are available. The editor’s voice should\ncome over strongly. In the wealth of textual variants, which may appear to the\nuser as huge informational noise, the editor’s critical advice is as important as\never. The challenge is to evolve a new kind of digital accountability allowing\nthe user to track these decisions and possibly reject them on ideological or\nfactual grounds.\n\nThe digital age has redefined the practice of textual scholarship, but so far this\nredefinition has in no way led to any revolution in our fundamental understand-\ning of texts. What it has revolutionized is our way of working with texts, because\nit has given us new and extremely versatile tools in organizing and analyzing\ntexts and their history. Moreover, in many cases digital editions have become\ndynamic and interactive by moving the focus from the editor to the users, from\nthe editor as a controller of the text to users as re-creators of texts. In short,\ndigital editions have the potential of being truly dynamic in a way that a printed,\npaper-based edition never can be. Yet no revolution lies in the tools as such, but\nrather in the extent that these tools are being used in ways that lead to a new\nunderstanding of texts, to new questions being raised.

The purpose of this book is to\ntry to sketch some answers to the question of whether new digital tools augur\nanew kind of textuality.\n\nNotes\n\n1. The term Sitz im Leben goes back to the theologian Hermann Gunkel (2967, 1998)\nbut has since spread to other literary disciplines, among other contemporary text prag-\nmatics (see Wagner 1996).\n\n2. “Wir sollen und wollen aus einer hinreichenden Menge von guten Handschriften\neinen allen diesen zum Grunde liegenden Text darstellen, der entweder der urspriingliche\nselbst seyn, oder ihm doch sehr nahe kommen muss” (Miillenhoff and Vahlen 1876, 82).\n\n3. “Je ne connais ni erreurs, ni fautes communes, ni bonnes, ni mauvaises lecons, mais\nseulement des formes diverses du texte, sur lesquelles, par une méthode qui sappuie sur\ndes statistiques rigoureuses, je délimite d’abord les familles, puis je classe les manuscrits\ndans lintérieur de chacune delles, et enfin les familles entre elles” (Quentin 1926, 37).\n\n4. The use of various quantitative methods is discussed in somewhat more detail in\nchapter 8.\n\n5. The term “Nouvelle Critique” should be kept distinct from the term “New Criticism?\nThe first term describes a postwar literary movement in France initiated by Roland. The\nsecond term describes an American literary movement that stretched from the interwar\nperiod to the 1950s in the United States.\n\n6. See, for example, Bolter (2001); Landow and Delany (1991), Landow (1992); Delany\nand Landow (1994); Aarseth (1996 and 1997); and Landow (2006).\n\n7. Woolf Online (www.woolfonline.com) illustrates such reintegration of genealogical\nand genetic aspect in an outward perspective.\n\n8. “La naissance du lecteur doit se payer de la mort de fauteur” (Barthes 1984, 69).\n\n9. One example is the commercial policy of the digital edition of the complete works\nof Pierre Bayle (Corpus des ceuvres completes de Pierre Bayle), published in the Classiques\nGarnier Numérique collection.\n\n10. “The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in\nwhich information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people\nto work in cooperation” (Berners-Lee, Handler et al. 2001).\n\nu.

Ongoing Challenges\nfor Digital Critical Editions\n\nPHILIPPE REGNIER\n\nAs observed in this beginning of the twenty-first century, the reality of “digital\ncritical edition” is still too embryonic and too unstable, even though it is de-\nveloping, to be considered only in its present state and to be adopted without\nwondering about its future. It is indeed a strange situation where one has the\nimpression of leaving the familiar and well-established world of printed books\nfor the adventure and the risks ofa medium commonly described as immaterial,\nin perpetual evolution, and without rules. Let us dare state up front that the\nissue at stake is neither external nor temporary: philology, this old lady born of\nthe marriage of humanism and printing, is from now on definitely confronted\nwith the question of its media mutation.\n\nIn facing this opportunity for modernization—which stands a good chance\nof increasingly often imposing itself as a necessity—philology finds itself at a\ncrossroads of rather diverse choices, with the moral obligation, however, whatever\nthe path chosen, to remain loyal to its fundamental values. Briefly said, philology\nmust reassess its strategy to take into account digital technology. It can no lon-\nger remain apart if it does not want to be paralyzed or isolated. It can no longer\nremain a passive user if it does not want to find itself confined in inadequate\nframeworks. Philology needs to be endowed with a vision of its future.\n\nBut thinking about prospects of the future, as one knows, is similar to the\nutopian method invented by Thomas More, which consists of examining, criti-\ncizing, and especially interpreting what exists at the moment of writing in order\nto imagine what could or should exist tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

The enthusiasm of some philologists is equaled only\nby the grimness of others.\n\nThis is not astounding, considering, as recalled in the preceding chapter, that\nthe theoretical advances of printed philology, its norms and presentation tech-\nniques result from two centuries of discussions that were much more strenuous\nthan commonly imagined, without having ever reached a unique and definite\nmodel. The contrary would be surprising, one is tempted to say, considering\nthe diversity of schools of thought and practices.\n\nFocusing on digital edition, it would seem fit to assess the issues at stake, and,\nconsidering the precedent printing effects, to dismiss no hypothesis—neither the\nstrongest ones nor the wildest—in trying to find the most stimulating one, the\none that would have digital edition at the heart of a general process of change.\n\nQuantitative Change or Qualitative Mutation:\nCultural Catastrophe or Progress?\n\nA common opinion consists in denying the problem formulated as a question\nin the header above.

The question\nretained is not the improvement of or change in editing but how to edit more,\nmuch more, and more rapidly, for the immense number of readers who now\nhave overdeveloped reading capacities.\n\nLet's take, for example, a thirty-year-old precedent: text processing and com-\nputer-aided publishing. These major inventions seem to have corresponded\nexclusively to increases in productivity and quickly fallen into oblivion and\nindifference as their use became generalized and their access available to most\npersons writing and publishing. In the same way, computer-assisted editing and\nreading tomorrow could result in nothing more than an increase of existing\ncapacities. Has anyone seriously contended that the forms of the printed book\nwould have directly provoked any type of scientific revolution?\n\nOn the other hand, however, would anyone contest the obvious fact that\nboth inventions have completely reformatted our very way of thinking? And,\nmore deeply still, that they have definitely brought about a new humanity? The\npassage from print to digital could eventually turn out to be as decisive as the\npassage from Stone Age to the Bronze Age or the one from manuscript to print.\n\nFor the time being, current daily experiences with digital texts often involves\nusing websites where the site authors are sparingly identified, ifat all, and there\nis usually no information concerning where the site is located or when it was set\nup: looking for a quick answer, users arrive through the guidance of a generalist\nand commercial web search engine.

A close examination of more elaborated\ndigital publications nevertheless leads to similar thoughts at the basic level of\ntextuality itself.\n\nLet us begin, as an introduction, with the example of the 2001 online publi-\ncation of a literary monument whose philosophical dictionary nature seemed\npredestined to a digital transposition—that is, the Dictionnaire historique et\ncritique de Bayle. Useful whatever the case, the digital version provides easy ac-\ncess to a major text that previously was available only in libraries. It results from\nthe work, among others, of a Franco-American project for a treasury of French\nlanguage (Trésor de la langue francaise) known as the ARTFL Project (Ameri-\ncan and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language), conceived\nand carried out by a team from the Analyse et Traitement Informatique de la\nLangue frangaise (ATILF) of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\n(CNRS) on the French side and by the Division of the Humanities, the Division\nof the Social Sciences, and the Electronic Text Services (ETS) of the University\nof Chicago on the American side.* Due to its display in facsimile on the screen,\nBayle’s digitized dictionary has retained its very special page layout. The reader\ncan read the text by scrolling page by page. The reader can also read the text\nby using a table of contents endowed with hyperlinks, navigating from article\nto article, from volume to volume, much more rapidly than would be possible\nwith the heavy physical volumes laid on one’s table, following the complex routes\nprovided by Bayle and his collaborators, who needed to outsmart censors and in\norder to allow one to make out the coherence of the instigating ideas. But with\nthe exception of a few succinct pages explaining the project and describing the\ntext and its characteristics, there are no comments to guide the nonspecialist\n\n \n\nreader neither within articles nor in his course from article to article. In the\nlight of philological norms, however, the greatest flaw is that the e-editors do\nnot provide access to what would have been the main interest of a genuine edi-\ntion: the large-scale reorganizations and enrichments from which stems the text\nthey have chosen—that is, the last authorized edition (Amsterdam, 1740). Even\nmore radical comments have been voiced against the two digitized versions of\nDiderot’s Encyclopédie.’ By being digitized, this sun of the Enlightenment era\nhas become, according to Philippe Stewart, a “fragmented galaxy.’ The digital\nmachine, he explains, is incapable of following the semantic road of correlations\nbetween articles that produces all the subversive quality of the textual system:\nit only knows discrete words, quantified in bytes (2002, 190). The general argu-\nment is completely obvious: these e-editions of philosophical dictionaries are not\ncritical editions; they are databases. To sum up, it seems that two observations\ncan be made: (1) that there exists a tension, perhaps already a rupture, between\n\n   \n\f"

What would be the purpose? In fact, there is little doubt that such digital\neditions did not answer specialists’ refined needs. But by the very fact of their\navailability, and whatever the elementary character of the intellectual operations\nthat they facilitate (lexical studies, checking a quotation, curiosity exploration,\nand so on), they have a utility and an efficiency that nonspecialist research-\ners are apt to appreciate. They probably open the way for digital critical edi-\ntions of monuments whose size constitute an invincible challenge. This is even\ntruer since commercial publishers of living dictionaries, such as the Larousse,\nthe Robert, or the Universalis Encyclopedia, have committed themselves to the\nproduction of digital versions and, consequently, are now contributing to the\ndevelopment of more complex software and to formatting solutions in answer\nto users’ demands.\n\nMoreover, it is not entirely a coincidence if the majority of initiators and au-\nthors of the experiences referred to above do not come from the field of French\nliterature, a discipline that, within established role sharing, should have presided\nover their conception and their elaboration, and where the above-mentioned\nobjections come from. It is because of its technical incompetence, which is not\nwithout remedy, that this discipline has been confined to watching the evolu-\ntion of linguistics and informatics, or more exactly, language engineering and\ncomputer engineering.\n\nSuch a phenomenal interdisciplinary takeover by sciences that are sometimes\nderogatorily qualified as “technosciences” is certainly not to be understood\nin terms of a decadence of traditional humanities. The history of science and\ntechniques needs to point out more than one transition achieved through in-\nterdisciplinary transfers. It is commonplace for the importing discipline that\nsuch transfers result from temporary compromises on norms. If the discipline\nsurvives the ordeal, its redeployment in a second phase can lead it to respond\nby inventing theories, methods, and norms that will assure it a new life. Phi-\nlosophy and literature benefited from such an experience during the ’7os when\nthey assimilated the concepts and methods of linguistics and semiology.\n\nIt must be pointed out also that, as opposed to first-generation digital editions\nthat exhibit their database structure, the editions that followed and that we will\nbe evoking here have chosen to be applied not to dictionaries but to continuous\ntexts.

Is it really so dif-\nficult for philology to adapt to the words and forms that come from the Internet?\nThe media changes between paper and screen, between ink and electrons, have\nwell-known predecessors that have been properly analyzed by writing and book\nhistorians as genuine transfers, not from discipline to discipline this time, but\nspecifically from one technical era to another technical era.\n\nSimplified character fonts have replaced calligraphic writings. Labels and con-\ncepts of title, author, and editor have replaced the copyist’s signature, amounting\nto, in short, a generalization of punctuation (period, comma, and their complex\nderivatives, beginning with the semicolon and the question mark). The num-\nbered page has become the basic reading unit (without columns or, preferably,\nwith only one column, which is the etymological meaning of the word “page”).\nDivision occurs in “volumes,” “parts? “chapters,” and “paragraphs.” Structural\nabstractions, such as the “table of contents” or “summary, function as reading\nguides. Marginal and bottom page “notes (in replacement, notably, of interlin-\near notes or of “chains” encircling the text as a fruit encircles its stone) and so\nforth invite the reader to focus on specific portions the text. All of these small\nmechanisms of our textual functioning that seem natural and as old as writing\nitself, today are, as a matter of fact, rather recent and fundamental inventions.*\nExpressions and practices based on new information and communication tech-\nnology that are ordinarily perceived as purely technical take on a quite different\nscientific and cultural dignity when referred to in the frame of long-term history.\n\nVery few scholars have taken the risk of going beyond observing and of\nmaking such an acknowledgment.’ But some time from now, maybe as soon as\nthe end of the twenty-first century, some modern scholar will be able to stand\nback and write the history of how humanity went not from the volumen to the\ncodex, and from the codex to the printed book, from the printed book to pe-\nriodical press, and of their long cohabitation, but the passage from the printed\nworld to the digital world—in other words, from the book to the “database,”\nfrom the “web page” to the “website,” from the “home page” or “web page” as\nsuch to a still unknown standardized reading unit (a “screen” defined in inch\nformat and in a number of visible dots?). Likewise, this scholar will also have to\nexplain how we have organized the migration of bottom page notes (and even\nstill marginal ones) to a hypertextual note system.

He or\nshe who has not been involved in the development of a database and a web-\nsite, who has not had the opportunity to be confronted with the obligation to\nthink in terms of fields and to organize an arborescence, cannot understand\nnor measure the problem.

This publication, begun in 2002, is defined by Grof as a “digital edition”\nof the works and the correspondence of the writer. Practically, the main objec-\ntive is to provide online access, while occasionally adding corrections, to the\ntwo printed critical editions of the complete works of Heinrich Heine that were\nalready published conjointly in former East Germany and West Germany. But\nto this objective of scientific (without fusion) reunification of the two editions\nhas been added an (immaterial) reunification objective between the philological\nproductions and the original texts themselves, as the Heinrich-Heine-Portal of-\nfers access in image mode to manuscripts and editions, as well as press articles,\npublished during the author's lifetime. In addition to these components, there\nare other disjecta membra poetae, engravings, and contemporary portraits, with a\nforthcoming general bibliography. There is also information on current research\nactivities about Heine. Consequently, Gro (2005) describes the project as that of\na “complete platform” for the study of this author. Incidentally, the German title\nof the article is worded in terms that effectively refer to something completely\ndifferent from a critical edition and translates as “Digital Heine—An Internet\nportal offering an integrated information system.’ In taking up and continuing\nthe masterly “critical editions” in order to transform them into something bet-\nter and different, presented as a kind of digital reincarnation of the author, the\nHeine portal “surpasses” them all in reference to the subtle Hegelian meaning\nof the Aufhebung, implying simultaneously both abrogation and perservation,\nby its integration into a greater whole built on the more general information\nprinciple rather than on a principle of edition.\n\nForging new words turns out to be all the more difficult when the words are\nnot imposed by the universal newspeak of computers, because the subsumed\nproducts are themselves quite diverse, they are composites, and they correspond\ntoa variety of quite diverse scholarly projects.

This would result in not only freezing each one in positions that are bound\nto evolve but also situating the debate at the superficial level of tendencies, if\nnot fads, and not in the field of the science of texts. The decisive question is\nthis: Are there specifically scientific effects to be expected from the use of digital\ntechnology?

To complicate mat-\nters, these actors may choose a CD-ROM solution at times and an Internet\none at others;* they may also prefer sometimes websites, sometimes databases,\nand sometimes websites with databases, sometimes portals; they may either\nstick to black and white or use color.

In modern philology this is also the case, particularly\nin France, with the dogma of the last authorized version, based on the same\nhalf-scientific, half-religious cult of the creative origins, or, if one prefers, with\na belief in the authentic spirit and the exact letter. In both cases it is a question\nof going back to the original text or restoring it by removing all the errors, ad-\nditions, and interpolations that have been agglomerated to the original text.\nHowever, the opposite tendency exists, resulting from the digital offer itself,\nbut extends, revives, and accelerates a fundamental tendency of printing. It is\nthis propensity to include more and more elements, be they diverse, massive,\nmore or less prior, or external or foreign to the considered text. This tendency\nconfirms the legitimacy of these elements based on the fact that they exist. It\nproposes to take them into account and to interpret them inasmuch as they are\nthe indisputable remnants of the semantic investment of copyists, exegetes, and\neditors standing on the shoulders of original authors.\n\nWithout even evoking the expansion of the canons of philology and the in-\nclination toward their abolition that represents the scholarly republication of\nso-called illegitimate texts (because they are popular, anonymous, outside of the\nestablished categories, etc.), we observe that printed critical editions of modern\ntexts have not ceased since their beginnings and are constantly revising their\ndoctrinal basis in continuously pushing back the sacrosanct notions of author\nand authority:\n\n* From edition of works published by authors during their lifetime up to the\nposthumous editions of the fragmentary and disordered drafts, even those\nnever meant for publication\n\n* From the edition by an author of his own letters addressed to a specific per-\nson up to the exhaustive posthumous edition of his active correspondence,\neven his general correspondence\n\n« From the edition of unpublished and/or unfinished works to the publication\nof unprocessed manuscripts (through facsimiles and diplomatic editions),\npersonal diaries, notebooks, rough copies, genetic files, reception files\n\n \n\nThe widely practiced whistleblowing on the interest allegedly manifested for\nBaudelaire’s and Nietzsche's laundry bills summarizes the problem and the mis-\nunderstandings.

The truth is that theories have more often followed this\nevolution and accompanied it, even if it meant having to come up with justifi-\ncations after the fact. One finds here, along with scientific paradigm changes,\nradical taste and aesthetic changes.

The multiplicity of material supports, their hierarchy, their\nnewness or outdatedness, their succession or their cohabitation are the cause\nand the matter of philological activity: beyond the very quest itself for the inac-\ncessible original text, this is precisely what philology is in charge of managing.\nWhy wouldn't the digital era have to invent its own manner of recovering and\nmanaging texts, text derivatives, and the textual environments of the printing\nera? It is this immense construction endeavor that the Google, Amazon, and\nEuropeana projects are launching.

It is also hard to imagine\nthat they could take the liberty of not delivering everything.\n\nTheir other great quarrel is the one that has the holders of the text closure and\nimmanent criticism battling against the supporters of the historical inscription\nand its contextualization. To say it in grossly simplified words, the first orienta-\ntion brings together structuralism and formalism in general, among which are\nthe Ecole de Genéve (Geneva School), gender poetics, and textual genetics.\nThe second orientation encompasses Marxism and sociologisms in general,\nincluding sociocriticism and literary history.” Without being fully applicable\nto philological problems, this line of division notably applies in the cleavage\nbetween German historical criticism (die historische-kritische Ausgabe) and\nFrench genetic criticism. The first one tends to put texts in communication\nwith an unlimited historical material, while the second, less removed from the\nEcole de Genéve than it will acknowledge, adopts the Saussurian principle of\nthe epistemological break. In other words, unlike historical criticism, genetics\ndoes not content itself with tending toward putting history between brackets.

In fact, the book form and the\ncorresponding academic uses seem to oblige a scholarly editor to follow only\none method, inasmuch as the book (or the series of volumes) is what identifies\nhim and gives existence to his work, whereas the Internet forms seem to invite\ngrouping, inasmuch as the extent of the surface occupied is the best guarantee\nfor success in the competition for visibility.

Unless\nthey intend to abuse their scientific authority, twenty-first-century philologists\nmust also explain how they have worked, how the text has been written and\nedited in its original context—in other words, how it developed and then how\nit was reedited, altered, or reestablished—and, in the end, and independently\nof any value judgment, how it has been enhanced by its transmission. Finally,\nphilologists can also be held responsible for the functional and aesthetic quality\nof the digital framework to which they entrust their work and that results in a\nnew text avatar. To put it plainly, they have to collaborate on the invention of\ndigitized text standards in the same way that their remote ancestors progres-\nsively created standards for pagination, tables of contents, and all the display\nreferred to above, for the printed text. It is at the cost of all these tasks that they\nparticipate in a kind of continuous creation.\n\nLet us put forth a suggestion to loop the loop: would it not be appropriate\nto throw a bridge over these thoughts concerning the co- and post-authorial\nrole of the scholarly editor and the various theories that praise the legitimacy\nand the creativity of copies and variants, even those that are unauthorized,\nbut that leave the last editor, himself often the theorist personified, in a sort of\n\n   \n\f"

It is well known that these theories are dominant\nin the Anglo-Saxon world under the influence of the specific problems of the\nShakespearian philology (which has to deal with texts that lack the author's\nmanuscripts but have been staged even during the lifetime of the author, based\non more or less re-elaborated copies).** They have been intensified in Germanic\ncountries, in particular by Hans Zeller, who considers a text to be the totality\nof its manifestations and its attested intentions,” and by Hans Walter Gabler,\nwho has aroused passionate controversies in reconstructing Joyce's Ulysses\nfrom his unpublished manuscript rewritings up to making a completely new\nversion, said to be closer to Joyce’s intentions than even the one published by\nJoyce.“ This most recent modernity is reminiscent of the practice of copy-\nists in antiquity, who allowed themselves interpolations (without feeling the\nneed to point them out) with the commendable aim of providing a better\nand more complete text. We are only too well aware of that. Will we ever try\nto rediscover the contemporary meaning of their interpolations after having\ndenounced them for so long as a falsification practice? Taking into account\nsuch practices and the provoking pretension to be more Joycian than Joyce\nat least has the virtue of drawing attention to a certain textual plasticity and\nto the dynamics of their growth. Would it not be better to try to accompany\nand guide this process, comparable to that of a snowball that grows as it rolls\ndown the hill, rather than try in vain to stop it? In the general tendency to\naccumulate and amalgamate the greatest number of illegitimate elements\naround the original textual kernel, just as in the methodological proliferation\ngenerated by the diversity of textual realities, there is plenty to render obsolete\nthe current segregation between critical edition, historical-critical edition,\nand genetic edition.*\n\nBecause its material base and technologies legitimize a will to go to the end of\nan evolution that has been ongoing since the ’7os, tomorrow’s digital scholarly\nedition will probably make of this ambition its rule: aim at both a maximum\nof completeness and a plurality of approaches. We will thus establish a relation\nof continuity and excellence concerning as much critical editions as complete\nworks such as we know them—each one, finally, very organically tied to print-\ning.” In fact, scholarly “platforms” or “infrastructures” already offer a storage\ncapacity and data structuring and management techniques that are so superior\nto those of books that editors will not indefinitely restrain themselves from\nimitating books and maintaining themselves in such a framework in order to\npresent and communicate their works. This acknowledgment strongly encour-\nages predicting a philology as hypercritical as it will be hypertextual, respectful,\nindeed, of history and of the evolution of texts, but up to this ideal stage of\nnot wanting to choose and impose a unique “configuration”: a non-dogmatic\nphilology for a boundless textuality.\n\n   \n\f"

The Digital Fate\nof the Critical Apparatus\n\nDANIEL APOLLON AND CLAIRE BELISLE\n\nThe adoption of digital technologies has upset our relationship to texts and\nconfronts us with the long history of critical edition underlying this relation-\nship. The advent of the printing press had already put an end to the erratic\nfluctuation of texts that were subject to the hazards of physical or mechanical\nhand-copying. Many medieval manuscripts are assorted with maledictions is-\nsued by the author or the scribe against future counterfeiters, threatening them\nwith leprosy or burning in hell. These curses illustrate well how the old scribal\nculture based its conception of the intrinsic uniqueness of the text on prescrip-\ntions and prohibitions inherited from religious, popular, and legal traditions.\nText was to acquire its reproducible identity with manufacturing, although\nthis is a later phenomenon. With the development of printing technology and\nthe improvement of the organization techniques of distribution, new horizons\nwere opened up.\n\nPrinting, making mechanical reproduction possible, offered the prospect\nof a more durable, even permanent transmission of works and, eventually, a\ngreater stability of texts. The increased mechanical reproducibility of works\ncontributed to reinforce, industrialize, and modify a much older conception of\nthe uniqueness of texts. Within a few centuries, a new form of “textual positiv-\nism” emerged and brought together traditional philology, scientific positivism,\nand historicism, thus consolidating representations of the uniqueness of texts\nbased on rights of ownership and privileges in order to exploit works. Gradu-\nally, privileges—sometimes revocable, sometimes irrevocable—were granted\nto printers, publishers, or authors and acquired a specific legal dimension. The\nruling power guaranteed the uniqueness of the work, imposing various restric-\ntions on how the text could be reproduced. The printer and, gradually, the\nauthor would obtain a letter of privilege, provided they enjoyed some higher\n\n   \n\f"

Later on, accepting that the authenticity of the text builds upon a\nfaithful reproduction of the author's intentions became a common belief. Despite\nthe progressive installation of the author in his or her work (limpidly described\nby Cerquiglini 1989a, 25, quoting Michel Foucault; see also Cerquiglini 1989a,\ns7iff), this form of textual positivism, equating textual identity with the inertia\nand fixedness of the inscription as a token of the ownership of the author, hid\na more complex empirical reality characterized by a greater fluctuation and\ninstability of texts and their transmission. The distinction made by the critical\neditor between scribal and authorial variants (Cerquiglini 1989a, 119) became\nail the more important.\n\nThe fact that digital tools propel us into a state of greater editorial fluctuation\nshould be no surprise. This age-old fluctuation, being an inherent characteristic\nof the transmission of ancient texts antedating print technology, imposes itself\ntoday as the norm of digital writing. Such a generalized textual variability in the\ndigital era is neither accident nor fate. It reflects both how easily modifications\nand updates can be produced in a digital environment and how knowledge\nincreasingly can be shared by various means of collaboration. It is within this\nnew context that when migrating to digital medium, critical editions of texts\nand documents have been forced to redefine their ambitions about textual truth,\nscholarship, and sharing. This chapter outlines the contours of the scholarly\nproject and the ambitions of such critical editions as they begin to take shape\nin contemporary digital media.\n\nAlthough textual variation is an interesting phenomenon by itself, it also\nreflects a human dimension within culture.’ This is why each scholar who es-\ntablishes a critical edition operates with a set of presuppositions or assumptions\nthat are bundled with the work they have interpreted. Hence, one can speak\nof the epistemic program of a scholarly community being implemented by the\nauthor of a critical edition. Such a program reveals itself through the scholar’s\nintention to apply it knowingly to a documentary mass. While texts undoubtedly\nstill function as social organizers, especially in legal and commercial matters,\nvisions about the transparency of the text are no longer a matter of scholarly\ninterest. By denying traditional philology any significance for critical and cul-\ntural studies, various postwar academic and cultural currents have given this\nshift needed legitimacy. Accordingly, the above-mentioned textual positivism,\nwhich is rather naive in many respects but also quite useful as a social bond\nin other respects (see Lucien Febvre's remarks as quoted in the opening pages\nof Cerquiglini 1983), is being ever more relegated to a few increasingly mar-\nginalized disciplines (classical studies, romance philology, biblical exegesis,\nand textual criticism). Scholarly edition today is characterized by a diversity of\nhardly matching textual visions that link the production of meaning in a work,\nsometimes to the author's intentions, sometimes to a functional relationship be-\n\n   \n\f"

In this case,\nnot only does the potential readership escape any assignment to disciplinary\nboundaries, but, in addition, the diversity of possible presentations available to\nscholars induce them to target a readership composed of individuals possessing\nvery diversified competencies and exhibiting various levels of proficiency.\n\nThis chapter, after addressing some conceptual landmarks, raises questions\nabout three key aspects of critical editions:\n\n1.

While paging through these works,\nthe reader may experience an impressive editorial landscape of techniques and\nlayouts, being able to distinguish at first glance if she is holding a “critical?\n“scholarly, or “learned” edition.\n\n“Critical, “Scholarly, or “Learned” Editions\n\nAlthough these three terms are not completely synonymous, in order to simplify\nterminology in these pages, we intend to use the term “critical edition” to refer\nto a whole spectrum of editions of texts, documents, and collections that offer\nwell-defined and structured information relating to a clearly identified content.\nThus such a definition accepts both those editions that concentrate on produc-\ning commentaries and notes as well as computer-based resources that exploit\ndatabases and complex text markup. The term “critical edition” is preferred to\nthe term “philology, which belongs more to linguistics and textual stemmatics.\n“Critical edition,” then, refers to the specific study of texts with the intention to\nsecure their transmission as faithfully, authentically, and completely as possible,\nincluding information about the processes that have made it possible to establish\nthe selected and published text. By extension, “critical edition” can refer to ef-\nforts to establish (or restore) the possibility of interpreting a work as closely as\npossible to the intentions of the author (traditional version), to its immediate\ncontext (historicizing version), or to its uses during transmission through time\nand space. More recently “genetic critical editions” have taken their distance\nfrom the “final” text (e.g., the editio princeps) in order to document the diverse\nphases, items, traces, and residues left by the authorial process (this process is\nsummarized by the term “avant-texte”; see Lebrave 1997, 2006).\n\nUsing different presentation methods, these various editorial products express\na shared effort to provide readers with tools that may be used not only to help\nthem to refine their judgment on the authenticity and the genesis of texts, docu-\nment, and contents but also, quite simply, to help them to evolve a broader and\ndeeper understanding of the roots and environment of the text, thereby open-\ning reading to new horizons.

The distinction is between mini-\nmalist products, which provide the reader with very few but supposedly crucial\nclues on the history, interpretation, or historical context of the published text,\nand maximalist products, in which the amount and complexity of information\ncoded and stored about the text exceeds by far the text’s own magnitude (see\nBrossaud and Reber 2006).\n\nEditions, Editeurs, and Publication\n\nEach language, through its vocabulary, operates with a particular semantic\nmapping, which may sometimes generate areas of confusion for translators.\nPossible confusion may arise about which roles are being referred to when using\nthe French terms éditions, éditeur, and publication. For example, the distinction\nintroduced in English when using two different words—“editor,” referring to\nthe expert establishing the text to be published as authoritative, and “publisher”\ndesignating the person or commercial company responsible for producing and\ndistributing the work of the editor—has no counterpart in the French term\néditeur. In French éditeur is a term that needs to be completed in order to remove\nall ambiguity and make it possible to make a distinction between the specific\neditorial work that aims to establish the text and the production of material\nartifacts (see Catach 1988a, 22ff; see also 1988b). Similar precautions are needed\nto understand the distinction made in various languages between, for example,\n\n   \n\f"

The online archives of the double work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti ag-\ngregate texts, drawings, and paintings, juxtaposing several layers of collations\nand interpretation, an operation that would have been difficult to carry out on\naper. In the online Rossetti Archive, priority is given to the intertextual and\ntrans-textual dimensions. It is precisely in this domain that digital tools make\nit possible to innovate more radically, not only allowing one to escape from the\nmaterial constraints of print technology and from the boundaries of the book\nage but also opening new horizons for more eclectic projects that offer the\nossibility to “tag texts in several dimensions” (McGann 2004). Woolf Online,\na pioneer of its kind, publishes a multilayer online edition that associates a\ngenetic edition of Virginia Woolf’s novel Time Passes with a comprehensive\nvirtual contextual space. The major avant-texte of Woolf, the “Initial Holograph\nDraft? is presented using various aligned and synchronized synoptic layouts,\nallowing the reader to follow the evolution of Virginia Woolf's writing process\nstep-by-step. This avant-texte, being linked structurally to the “text” of the first\nrinted editions of the novel, is associated item by item with a vast contextual\nspace that covers the sociohistorical dimension (newspaper pages, film news,\nradio programs, testimonies from friends and public figures, history of the\nstrikes mentioned in the novel), geography, and biography (private journals,\netters, and photographs).\n\nThese two instances of an online critical edition illustrate briefly how digital\ntools make it possible to bring textual criticism and critical editions out of their\nstrong isolation. Paradoxically, digital tools already enable one to combine\ndiverse visions, treatments of the states of the text, and methodologies that\nwere difficult to bring together in the age of printed editions. It is perfectly\npossible today, as already demonstrated by Woolf Online, to associate a clearly\nphilological edition, in all accepted meanings of the term, with other layers\nthat map contextual, intertextual, and hermeneutical dimensions. Already in\n1984, well before the appearance of the first online critical editions, Nina Catach\nexploited the findings of a survey to provide an inventory of the multivalent\nuse of the terminology of critical editions (e.g., “variant,” “text edition,’ “edi-\ntor”), exploring their underlying presuppositions and disparate treatment in\norder to defend the hypothesis of the multiplicity of critical edition.

The\ntext is viewed more as an instance of the world, a snapshot or confluence that\nbecomes interesting by situating it within the flux that surrounds it. A text\nfunctions simultaneously on several literary, cultural, social, and other levels\nthat critical editions need to take into account. Such is the case of poststruc-\nturalist perspectives that stress the multiplicity of methods, deconstruction,\ndecentering of the literary work, and the many modes of function of a work.\nHence, any digital edition may be viewed as a medium that amplifies already\nexisting practices and allows one to include various perspectives on text\nanalysis. The result is that historical positivism can be transgressed in various\nways. The first transgression is obviously linked with the impact of the Nou-\nvelle Critique on philology. The second type of transgression, which is more\ndifficult to identify, draws on “material philology” inspired by Cerquiglini\n(1983), who dreams of restoring the materiality of the text in all of its splen-\ndor (indirectly, this theoretical stance opens interesting future perspectives to\nunderstand “dematerialized” online texts).\n\nMatthew Driscoll (2010) undertakes to explain how this “material philology”\nconstitutes a new deal for critical edition:\n\nThe principal innovation in the area of editorial theory in recent years has been\nthe so-called “new” or “material” philology, the call to arms for which was the\npublication in 1990 of a special issue of Speculum, edited by the romance philolo-\ngist Stephen Nichols of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The immediate\ninspiration for this new philology came from Bernard Cerquiglini’s polemical essay\nEloge de la variante trom 1989 [originally published in 1983], which marked a clear\nturning point in the history of medieval textual studies by arguing that instability\n(“variance”) is a fundamental feature of chirographically transmitted literature:\nvariation is what the medieval text is “about? |... ] Literary works do not exist\nindependently of their material embodiments, and the physical form of the text\nis an integral part of its meaning; one needs therefore to look at “the whole book,”\nand the relationships between the text and such features as form and layout, il-\nlumination, rubrics and other paratextual features, and, not least, the surrounding\ntexts.

The choice to include these items\n(or not) betrays the epistemological project of the editor. According to some,\nthese items are not part of the critical apparatus but belong to a more general\ndiscourse about the world. A shift occurs, then, to a form of textual criticism that\namounts to a conscious production of discourse that from the point of view of\nthese critics moves away from the primary knowledge object of critical edition:\nthe original state of the text. In offering new possibilities for presentation, digital\ntools have the potential to change analytical practices by allowing, organizing,\nand presenting different procedures pertaining to production, interaction, and\ntransactions between the various actors involved.\n\nThe three main components that constitute a critical apparatus (we limit\nthe description, as an example, to the case of traditional critical edition) are\nthe following: The first component is the selection of sources, including the\ntextual witnesses and the explanation for and justification of editorial deci-\nsions. Usually any critical edition needs to provide a register of all the source\nsymbols and scribal abbreviations that will be displayed in the critical apparatus\n(such symbols are usually termed in the plural form “sigla”). Depending on\nthe magnitude of the edited textual tradition, the editor can either establish\nhis own nomenclature (e.g., in the case of an isolated work) or borrow from\nwell-established conventions (e.g., in biblical textual criticism). Depending on\nwhether the manuscript text witnesses are few or many, the editor will have to\ndecide to carry out either an exhaustive or a selective collation of representative\nvariants. In the last case, he will have to justify the selection criteria that have\nbeen applied (for example, in the critical editions of the New Testament, few if\nany of the readings of minuscule manuscripts are quoted, much less selected,\nwhile most ifnot all variants in the papyri are quoted). In a digital environment\nthe choices are more open: the critical editor can avoid making such decisions,\nfirst, by carrying out an exhaustive collection of textual data (digitizing texts\nusing text encoding) and then, in a second phase, by developing a set of rules,\nwhich the editor or user may use in order to select more relevant sub-views.\nBy adding mechanisms that exploit various search, parsing, and classification\nalgorithms, it will be possible to make automatic and reversible selections, a\nsituation unthought of just a few decades ago.\n\nThe collation of variants exploiting the selection of sources can be either ex-\nhaustive, at the risk of registering graphical and orthographical variants without\nrelevance for the ongoing project, or more or less selective, giving priority to\n“readings” that are deemed important. These variants, now registered and linked\nto their source, allow diverse decisions and conjectures that may ultimately\nallow a reconstruction of the text that, hopefully for the editor, is close to the\nhypothetical original. Additionally, the textual critic can exploit these variants\nin order to reconstruct the transmission history of the text to modern times.\n\n   \n\f"

The critical\napparatus can be very scant, either because the textual tradition that is studied\nattests to few significant variants (as is the case in several works of Ibsen), or\nbecause the editor or publisher wishes to spare his or her readers the cognitive\noverload that a sigla-rich textual apparatus may cause. Diverse layout strate-\ngies allow the editor to facilitate the access to critical notes: the most common\nmethod involves splitting the critical apparatus into several layers in order to\ndistinguish, for instance, purely orthographic variants from so-called significant\nvariants. Likewise, commentaries that cover factual or material information can\nbe allocated a specific form and a distinct layer within the critical edition. It is\nobvious in a digital environment that a strategy that aims to reproduce the book\nworld as faithfully as possible may grossly fail to tap the available hypertextual\ndynamics. Hence it is perfectly imaginable that an online critical edition does\nnot offer its users any system of layered notes under the text, but offers diverse\nperspectives and “views” (e.g., synoptic layout of various sources, parallel read-\ning displaying synchronized facsimile, diplomatic and normalized views, or\nlocal interaction using pop-up windows).\n\nThe identity of the project is revealed through the choices of the types of\ncommentaries or remarks that are included in a given critical edition.

Electronic critical edition encour-\nages one to take into account and present more material, to offer more tools\nand versions, thus facilitating the work of reading peers who want to follow\nhypotheses that may diverge from the stance taken by the editor/publisher of\nthe site. Moreover, by taking into account new objects of study, such as blogs,\nwikis, or visual animations in electronic literature, the scholar may be forced\nto go beyond the immediate context of plain texts and books as part of his or\nher editorial undertaking. As Shillingsburg writes, beyond all the focus on the\npermanent evolution of software and hardware, “we need more people thinking\ndeeply about ways in which texts translated into new mediums lose old functions\nas they acquire new functions and how interactions with texts in the electronic\nworld differ from interactions with print editions” (2006, 145).\n\nOn the other hand, critical edition tends to impose itself as a cultural norm.\nA new intercultural epistemic vision allowing a wider distribution of critical\ninformation emerges from online work.

It is best exemplified\nby referring to the possibility of merging the process of critical edition and\ninformed reading by calling upon readers to contribute to or even modify an\nedition. This implies a new acknowledgment of the potential of these readers\nand users to contribute, individually or collectively, in order not only to improve\nand complement a critical edition but also to add original contributions using\ntextual data made available online.\n\nThe fourth frontier is multiplicity: no longer is the choice limited, for example,\nto producing either strict genealogical editions or more ecological editions,\nsuch as highlighting external information. Widely different epistemological\nprojects, formerly incompatible, can now cohabit and interact by means of\nlayered markup within a common digital environment. One example is Woolf\nOnline, where extracts from films, pictures, newspaper excerpts, and a wealth\nof biographical documents are linked to the published novel and its avant-texte,\nalthough without putting up obstacles to the establishment of a text that adheres\nto traditional critical standards. Such products may well herald the advent ofa\nnew text epistemology, bridging over old controversies and, as one might expect,\ngenerating new ones.\n\nThe Choice of the Presentation: Recent Solutions\nand New Challenges\n\nThe various choices of presentation, in print or online, are not only motivated by\naesthetics and ergonomics. Any kind of online and on-paper presentation also\nactualizes the epistemological project that is inherent to a given critical edition.\nThe spatial and dynamic layout accessible on a computer screen expresses in\niverse ways some knowledge to be shared.\n\nWe have argued in the preceding pages that it is possible to implement on-\nline critical edition projects that express widely different ambitions and visions\nsimultaneously. Hence, such online projects can vary between two opposites.\nAt the first extremity one finds general-purpose projects that may be synthetic,\nmultilayered, ecological, and so on, offering to resituate texts in their historical,\ncultural, and literary environments. In these projects the editor and, if possible,\nthe readers are not searching for the “true” text (although this question may not\nbe rejected as such) but are more interested in using the text regardless of its\nstate in order to open a window on a world to discover. At the other extremity\none finds online critical edition projects that operate within the strict perspec-\ntive of traditional philology.

This\nlast position matches well the established, elitist historical positivism described\nearlier in this chapter.\n\nHence, the choices made for presenting the critical apparatus actualize the\nepistemological stance and communication strategy of the editor. The diverse\npossibilities offered by information technologies will concretize these choices.\n\nCritical editions on paper, since they do not allow variable layout, make the\ntext fixed in its mold and freeze it in its new state. The paper-and-book tool\nimposes the absolute boundary of the frame of the page and thus puts severe\nrestrictions on the presentation of the critical apparatus. It could materialize\nas occasional short notes or, inversely, as a critical apparatus/text ratio that is\nclearly in the favor of the critical apparatus (as illustrated by Moshe Goshen-\nGottstein’s monumental and prematurely interrupted critical edition of The\nHebrew University Bible Project). The paper culture implicates a hierarchy that\ngives prominence to text over image, the notion of critical edition being applied\nin practice mostly to texts and very seldom to images (although all principles\ninherited from critical philology may apply to, say, cinematic work). From the\nnineteenth century, for industrial and ergonomic uses, publishers prefer in-\ncreasing the number of pages rather than increasing the size of the page. The\nappearance of the photographic facsimile allows more details to be displayed—\nfor instance, in spite of the size restriction of the book page, one could read\nfacsimiles of uncials and minuscules. During the twentieth century, while an airy\nlayout makes its appearance in editions targeting the general public, allowing\nmore blank areas and making the text easier to read, critical editions stick to\npages crammed with text and sigla and deliver critical apparatuses at the limit\nof readability.\n\nOnline digital presentation offers new possibilities for concretizing the rela-\ntionship between the critical apparatus and the work. A number of constraints\nimposed by the surface of the printed page disappear. The page area will have\nto be reconfigured within the frame of the display and satisfy new readability\nrequirements. However, whatever size it may have and whatever visual comfort\nit may offer, a display is far from being a universal panacea for all woes caused\nby printing technology. Organizing and presenting information architectures\nwith an increasing underlying complexity poses serious challenges to online\ncritical edition. In the wake of interactive possibilities that are proposed to the\nusers, new cognitive problems appear. For example, the disappearance of the\ntraditional critical apparatus in favor of user-selected visualizations encourages\na continuous switching between various points of views on the texts.

What Digital Remediation Does\nto Critical Editions and Reading Practices\n\nTERJE HILLESUND AND CLAIRE BELISLE\n\nIn migrating their editorial work on literary resources from print to digital\ntechnology, researchers have heeded new challenges and ambitions for schol-\narly editions. This chapter addresses these objectives by looking at designs,\naims, and uses of existing scholarly editions as they migrate from one media\nto another. The first part deals with issues and questions raised by the digital\ntrend in scholarly text studies and with the shift in how historical texts are re-\ncorded, presented, and studied. Confronting the optimistic promises of added\nvalue that digital editions will bring to scholarly works, we explain through the\nconcept of remediation how traits and configurations of editions that are pres-\nent in print technology live on in digital technology even though text creation\nand dissemination have profoundly changed. Underscoring both the fragility\nof digital information, as compared to the long-lasting paper document, and\nthe extreme versatility of its representation, which makes it capable of answer-\ning a wide variety of scholarly reading expectations, we conclude that changes\nexpected in scientific aims and methods are still to come. Digital remediation\nof text is taking place within a digital context that is impelling new reading\nhabits. Exploring these new emerging reading practices, coupled with a prob-\ning of readers’ expectations, forms the object of the second part of the chapter.\nHaving observed how reading evolves with digital technology, we explore the\nenduring uses and the disruptive changes that organize the new ways readers\nrelate to texts and documents mediated by digital technology. Finally, a brief\noverview presents the challenges that textual scholars will face if they choose\nto attend to the new expectations of readers as the digital medium becomes the\nmain work area for reading and working with critical editions.\n\f"

Without trying to\nprovide definite answers, this chapter presents issues and questions raised by the\ndigital trend in scholarly text studies, using the British Library's online gallery as\nan example of digital libraries and the Canterbury Tales Project as an example\nof digital scholarly editions. Is digital technology simply a new means of gaining\naccess to materials existing in another medium, or does it bring radical changes\nin the representation of texts and documents? Jay David Bolter and Richard\nGrusin addressed this issue in their groundbreaking study of the differences\nbetween media by coining the concept of “remediation.” Remediation refers to\nthe refashioning that each new technology introduces in its presentation when\na medium tries to represent another medium. “Like their precursors, digital\nmedia |... | will function in a constant dialectic with earlier media, precisely\nas each earlier medium functioned when it was introduced” (Bolter and Grusin\n2000, 50). As remediation involves a claim of improvement, it can be under-\nstood as a process of cultural competition between consecutive technologies\nthat present scholarly editions. But does digital technology entail more, as the\n“endless crescendo of enthusiasm and expectations with which Western culture\nis greeting digital media” (267) would let one believe? The chapter examines\nsome of the scholarly implications of the ongoing digital remediation of text.\nAs a starting point, it looks briefly at an earlier shift in the history of text: the\ntransition from manuscripts to printed books.\n\nFrom Manuscripts to Print to Digital Media\n\nRecuyell of the Histories of Trove was the first book ever to be printed in English.\nThe story was translated from French and printed by William Caxton in 1473\nin Bruges. Caxton was the first English printer, and in a concluding letter in\nthe book, after a description of the laborious work on the translation, Caxton\npraises the new invention of print:\n\nAnd for as much as in the writing of the same my pen is worn, my hand weary\nand not steadfast, my eyes dimmed with overmuch looking on the white paper\n[...] and also because I have promised to diverse gentlemen and to my friends\nto address to them as hastily as I might the said book, therefore I have practiced\nand earned at my great charge and dispense to ordain this said book in print after\nthe manner and form as you may here see, and is not written with pen and ink as\nother books been, to the end that every man may have them at once.’\n\n   \n\f"

Despite this interest, Geoffrey Chaucer's own manuscript, the pre-\nsumed archetype (ifit indeed existed as more than gatherings of autographed\nquires), has never been found. Still, many early manuscripts and incunabula\ndid survive, and in England an ambitious effort has been made to digitize all\nextant manuscripts and printed versions of The Canterbury Tales produced\nbefore ap 1500. The Canterbury Tales Project officially started in 1993 under\nthe leadership of Norman Blake and later under the supervision and leadership\nof Peter Robinson. The project’s aim has been not merely to document the\nmanuscripts and books but, in addition, to digitally transcribe and analyze the\nentire collection of early texts. The transcripts of Caxton’s editions currently\npresented on the British Library website are done so in collaboration with the\nCanterbury Tales Project.\n\nThe British Library’s publication of Caxton’s editions of The Canterbury Tales\nonline definitely represents the beginning of a new chapter in the long history\nof Chaucer and exemplifies a new phase in the history of written text. Since the\nmedieval days of Chaucer and Caxton, the number of English-reading people\nhas grown remarkably, and even if Middle English texts are slightly unfamiliar to\nmost readers, with the proliferation of computers and diffusion of the Internet,\nmore people than ever before, interested in reading or peeping at the original\nCaxton editions of The Canterbury Tales, can do so by accessing the digital\nreproductions at the British Library website.\n\nThis new phase in the history of text, however, is not exclusively attributed\nto the potential scale of text dissemination. The long-term consequences of the\nconvergence of computer and network technologies into a new text medium\nare not at all obvious, but they are far-reaching and penetrating in more than\ngeographical terms and degrees of diffusion. The writing system itself, meaning\nthe characters and numbers, is as yet not dissimilar from the systems used in\nmanuscripts and print publications. However, there are significant differences\nin how digital texts are created and stored and how they are distributed and\npresented to the reader, and as Roger Chartier (1995) points out, new text fea-\ntures will inevitably change our conception of text, intellectual habits, and ways\nof reading, thus creating an entirely new framework for digital text editions.\nFor critical philology, these changes pose particularly significant challenges. To\ninterpret and explain text from one cultural paradigm—the world of written\nand printed text—by exploring, analyzing, and presenting it within a rather dif-\nferent cultural paradigm—the world of digital text—raises seemingly insoluble\nquestions, and editors must ask how it can be done without doing “violence\nto the texts by separating them from the original physical forms in which they\nappeared and which helped to constitute their historical significance” (Chartier\n1995, 22). The first step in trying to solve the challenge would be to examine\n\n   \n\f"

Thus, digital technology has clarified certain aspects\nof writing. For instance, in handwriting and printing, as in all traditional text\ntechnologies, storing and representation of text are done by the same means in\na combined process. In books and manuscripts, patterns applied to the surface\nof parchment or paper both record the text and make it legible in an enduring\nand fixed physical form (Hillesund 2005). The Ellesmere and Hengwrt manu-\nscripts have preserved versions of The Canterbury Tales for more than half a\nmillennium, as have the Caxton printed editions. In a digital environment, by\ncontrast, storing and representation of texts are done in separate operations; in\nthe internal computer system, texts are stored electronically (or externally in\nmagnetically or optical forms) as encoded binary digits independently of any\nvisual representation of the texts. From computer storage systems the encoded\ntext can be fetched and represented onscreen in word processors, web editors,\nor desktop publishing programs, in which they can be edited, altered, and re-\ncomposed. Digital texts are thus malleable and flexible, globally distributable,\nand easily accessible: from one computer the text can instantly be sent to an-\nother computer by way of e-mail, or it can be put online and globally accessed\n(Hillesund 2005).\n\nOn the web, texts are readable in browsers that are characterized by highly\ninteractive interfaces, window presentation, hyperlinks, and the use of multiple\nmedia and multimodal presentation (text combined with graphics, photos,\nvideos, or sound). In the new medium of connected computers, lots of new text\ngenres and written communication forms have evolved: e-mail, news groups,\nchat features, blogs, online newspapers and magazines, electronic books, search\nengines, digital learning materials, corporate websites, web stores, digital li-\nbraries, and social networking sites. On the British Library website exhibiting\nCaxton’s printed books, all pages of both books are presented. The photographic\nreproductions can be enlarged, and the text, typography, and illustrations can\nbe studied in detail; the two editions can be compared in parallel windows; the\ntexts can be searched; and there are links to transcripts, which pop up in ad-\nditional windows.\n\nWhen utilized in this way, texts are incorporated and represented in a new\nmedium; the texts are transformed and put into new uses in a remediation\nprocess in which features and possibilities of digital technology and network\n\n   \n\f"

Nevertheless, all printed publications still store and represent\nverbal text in a combined process, using ink on paper, creating a physical form\nin which texts of books, magazines, and newspapers are preserved, distributed,\nand read.\n\nCompared to printed publications, the networked computer is a very dif-\nferent text medium. After almost twelve hundred years, the physical object\nconveying the Diamond Sutra text can still occasionally be seen by the public\nin the Sir John Ritblat Gallery at the British Library. The text is clearly legible\nand intelligible for readers of Chinese. Easily readable as well is the interactive\nversion of the Diamond Sutra at the British Library's website. Whereas the\nexhibited physical paper roll displays a tiny section of this Buddhist text, the\ninteractive virtual version lets the user scroll through the whole text of the\nroll using a mouse. However, although web browsers clearly present the text\nof the sutra, having lost its status as a physical object, it is hard to establish\nwhere the actual text is located. A machine-readable and humanly illegible\nbinary representation is obviously stored at the British Library’s web server\nor in a database, yet articulations of the text result from end users browsing\nthe web. In order for the text to be visually presented, a lot of highly technical\noperations have to be initiated and performed. Commands must be processed\nby a computer; signals sent back and forth over the Internet; and digital rep-\nresentations and files fetched, packed, sent, unpacked, processed, and visually\npresented onscreen in such a complicated process that few people, if any,\nfully understand what is actually happening. In the Diamond Sutra case the\ntext is visible and humanly readable only as long as the computer is online\nand every bit of software and hardware is functioning and the power is on.\nThe readable text disappears the moment a user turns to another web page\nor turns off the computer. So where is the text? And more important, where\nwill this particular text witness be in three or four decades, when computers\nand storage systems have changed and up-to-date operating systems run new\napplications over presently unknown network systems representing text on\ndisplays not yet invented?

The\nphysical book is still dominant in many important areas of publishing and un-\ndeniably in the research field of critical editions. However, in the long history of\nwriting, digital technologies have made a huge difference in a very short time.\nWhether Emile Baudot’s development of a five-bit code system for the French\ntelegraph service in 1874 is reckoned as the beginning of digital text (this code\nsystem later developed into ASCII and the current Unicode Standard), or the\nstart of digital text is set to the 1960s and the utilizing of coded text in computers\n(first as an input/output method) can be a matter of taste. Itis a fact that comput-\ners developed into a full-fledged media for text communication during the 1980s\nand beginning of the 19908, with the spread of the Internet and introduction\nof the World Wide Web (Bolter 2001). In a very short time, historically speak-\ning, the digitization and communication of text has played a crucial role in the\ndevelopment of the computer and Internet, and vice versa: the development of\nconnected computers has profoundly changed text creation and dissemination.\nWhen these changes of text are analyzed using a model of a communication\ncircuit (Darnton 1990) or a text cycle (Hillesund 2005), it becomes clear that all\nstages or phases of the circuit or cycle are changed. Digital texts are written and\ncomposed using computers in word processors and editing software; they are\nmagnetically, electronically, or optically stored; they are transmitted (or rather\naccessed) over networks; they are represented in browsers (and other reading\nsoftware); and they are eventually read on computer screens, either of station-\nary or handheld devices. The entire text cycle has been digitized, and the social,\neconomic, and legal apparatus surrounding text circulation is correspondingly\naffected. Even the seemingly immutable Western writing system is changing, or\nat least the use of it, which is clearly seen in the communication forms of e-mail,\nchat, and text messages; in these a lot of new and creative ways of combining\nand using characters are established, especially among the young.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to state that, for traditional text cultures, digitization\nrepresents a crisis because it involves abrupt cultural changes, new rules of\nproduction and diffusion, a challenge to inherited expertise that is threatened\nto fall into obsolescence, and possibly a paradigm shift, which the second part\nof this chapter considers, as defined by Thomas Kuhn (1962). According to Jay\nDavid Bolter, “Digital technology is turning out to be one of the more traumatic\nremediations in the history of Western writing” (2001, 24). One reason, Bolter\nsays, is that digital technology changes the physical “look and feel” of writing\nand reading, and he quotes Roger Chartier, who argues that the current shift\n\n   \n\f"

It modifies\nnot only the technology for reproduction of the text, but even the materiality of the\nobject that communicates the text to the readers. Until now, the printed book has\nbeen heir to the manuscript in its organization of leaves and pages |... ] and its\naids to reading (concordances, indices, tables). The substitution of screen for codex\nis a far more radical transformation because it changes methods of organization,\nstructure, consultation, even the appearance of the written word. (Chartier 1995, 15).\n\nBy using the term “remediation,” Bolter is primarily preoccupied with the\nchanges in form and function of texts when adopted in the medium of con-\nnected computers, characterized, as they are, by interactivity, multimedia,\nhypertext, and immaterial and highly dynamic (or fluctuating) ways of rep-\nresenting content. Chartier emphasizes the constraints that new media forms\nimpose on the interpretation of text and the construction of meaning. For\nChartier, the “same” text apprehended through very different mechanisms of\nrepresentation is no longer the same. In his analysis Chartier examines how\nforms of transmission influence the styles of reading and how they define and\nconstruct new readership.\n\nDigitization thus reformulates all questions regarding text. For scholars\nworking with digital critical text editions, therefore, an awareness of trans-\nformation and remediation processes is of particular importance. Usually the\nobjects of study in critical editions are written or printed text from earlier\nperiods (such as the Chaucer manuscripts and Caxton’s printed editions).\nThese are transformed into digital formats for documentation, preservation,\nstudy, and research. Further research is conducted on the basis of remediated\nversions of texts, and questions inevitably arise regarding the status of the\ndigitized texts and their relations to the original texts. Are the researchers\nstudying the same texts? How does digitization affect the comprehension of the\nconcept “text”? How does it affect habits of reading? In a new digital paradigm,\nresearchers will have to reflect on how the transformation process—the digital\nencoding and transcription of text—entails methodological and theoretical\nconsiderations and contentions. Researchers are further required to ask if\nthe remediation of text—its visual representation in new media—promotes\nnew styles of reading and thus imposes constraints upon our understanding\nof texts of the past.\n\nA digital critical text edition is itself a significant witness of the long remedia-\ntion history of important texts, such as The Canterbury Tales.

The storage media of CD-ROMs, along with\nsoftware and equipment used to present their content, is doomed to be obso-\nlete relatively soon. If the materials and programs of these systems—contrary\nto expectations—stand prolonged erosion, future researchers studying initial\nphases of digitization will probably have to endure rigid library application\nprocedures to be allowed to use the delicate equipment needed to get a touch\nand feel of how early pioneers presented their attempts in the area of digital\ncritical text editions. The situation is paralleled in other domains, such as music\nand film, in which content that has been stored as vinyl records and rolls of film\nnecessarily has to be converted and remediated in order to be presented anew.\nIn this respect, obviously, the advantages of manuscripts and printed books are\nevident: as long as the object is preserved and it doesn't severely deteriorate, the\nrecorded content is represented in its original form. For libraries, preservation\nof digital content is a major issue, and for digital scholarly editions, this is a\ncircumstance that researchers have to contemplate.\n\nBut “outdatedness” is not only a matter of obsolescent storage format. It may\nalso be the result of obsolescent modes of production and control of these texts.\n\nDigital Photographic Text\n\nIn the Canterbury Tales Project the philologists have wisely made sure that their\ntranscripts and documentations at a prepublication level are recorded in formats\nthat are capable of uncomplicated conversions and continued remediations in\nfuture digital media, presumably taking advantage of network distribution. The\neditions so far published in the project are composed of three main elements:\ndigital images or facsimiles showing the text of the original manuscripts or books,\ndigital transcripts of the texts, and collation and phylogenetic software. Gen-\nerally, digital photography has more or less superseded traditional film-based\nphotography, and digital remediation of photography is in itself a very interest-\ning process. Digital images are extremely manipulable and versatile, and digital\nphotos are brought to new uses in print and in digital environments—that is,\non the web and in multimedia presentations. Digital images are displayed on\nail kind of devices, from small mobile phones and computers to wide-screen\ntelevisions, posters, and cinema screens. In scholarly editions, digital photos of\npages and objects are very useful, and some editions of The Canterbury Tales set\nanew standard for manuscript photography.

On the website of the Clerk’s Tale Project at New York\nUniversity, one of the collaborative partners in the Canterbury Tales Project,\nfour stages of this editorial work are described. As the first step, each manu-\nscript is transcribed and encoded. Transcription uses a character set designed\nto accommodate late-medieval English manuscripts, and encoding conforms\nto the guidelines of the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative, discussed elsewhere in\nthis book), which is a widely accepted standard for markup of electronic texts\nin the humanities. In the next steps, the different transcriptions are compared\nusing a collation software program, and the body of variants is analyzed using\nphylogenetic methods and software developed in evolutionary biology. Finally\neach tale is published on CD-ROM in a format allowing users to access images\nof every page of every manuscript and full-text electronic transcriptions of the\ntale, as well as making collocations and analyses based on stemmatic models,\nor so-called split-tree models. All elements of an edition are presented in an\ne-book reader, a software application in which multiple windows allow users to\nwork in parallel modes, compare different versions ofa tale, and simultaneously\ncarry out collocations and analyses. Since the first CD-ROM from the project\nwas published, both interface and software have improved, showing that digital\nremediation of text is a continuous process. In the latest editions, the e-book\nreader is loaded and integrated into the default web browser of actual users.\nAs with all digital remediations of text, the digital way of storing, represent-\ning, and manipulating text in scholarly editions challenges many deep-rooted\nrepresentations of text.

In\nsemiotics the concept of text is extended to all kinds of representations: writing,\nspeech, pictures, music, videos, and computer games, and any combination of\nthese. Scholarly digital editions deal mostly with texts produced and represented\nin written forms, sometimes including illustrations and certainly comprising\nanalysis of the form and materiality of the texts: most editions of The Canterbury\nTales include witness descriptions in which the styles of the scribes or composers\nare described along with accounts of ink, parchment, or paper and the bind-\ning of the manuscripts and incunabula. A text is thus traditionally regarded\nto be a product rather than a process; the text is the product of a process of\ntext production. In this sense, the text, as an artifact, has a physical existence\nof its own, independent of its sender and receiver. In addition to this concrete\nmeaning, the word “text” is frequently used in an abstract sense, signifying the\nverbal structure, or wordings, or the narrative structure underlying the physical\nrepresentations of the text. Taken in this abstract sense, the same text can be\ngiven different presentations, as when the text of an ancient manuscript is repro-\nduced in modern print, on the web, or as an e-book. Though different in form,\nail articulations can be said to represent the same text. This two-sided concept\nof text is inherent in much research on the subject: in editorial philology, as in\nthe case of The Canterbury Tales, when the original physical version of a text\nis missing, scholars carry out thorough stemmatic and genealogical analysis of\nthe extant text copies in order to reconstruct the closest possible approximation\nto the original text, which exists only in an abstract and theoretical form. The\ndouble meaning of the concept of text is also present in bibliographical theory,\nand the dual meaning clearly underpins the FRBR (Functional Requirements\nfor Bibliographic Records) model, published by the International Federation of\nLibrary Associations and Institutions in 1998. Conceptually, the model identifies\nentities on different levels representing different aspects of user interests in the\nproducts of intellectual endeavor and their bibliographic records (and it is not\nrestricted to books) (see fig. 4-2).\n\nThe entity “work, as defined in the model, is a distinct intellectual creation\nand can usually be ascribed to one or more creator(s), as The Canterbury Tales\nis ascribed to Geoffrey Chaucer. “Work” is a completely abstract entity, and a\nwork exists only in the commonality of content between and among the vari-\nous expressions of the work. The entity “expression” is the realization of a work\nand encompasses, for example, the specific words and sentences of a text (in the\nabstract meaning of the term). When a work is realized, the resulting expression\nof the work may be physically embodied in a medium such as parchment, paper,\nor compact discs. That embodiment constitutes a “manifestation” of the work\n(such as in the form of a text in the physical sense). In some instances, only a\nsingle exemplar is produced of the manifestation of a work, such as an author's\n\n   \n\f"

When realized onscreen, even encapsulated\ntexts point to external text recourses, sometimes directly through created links\nand always indirectly by links from words and phrases to dictionaries and search\nengines or, for that matter, to automatic translation software or artificial reading\napplications.

In these, of course, the covers of the book define the boundaries of the\ntext. The flexibility of digital texts, such as in digital scholarly editions, also allows\nusers to constantly rearrange text, use multiple windows and multiple media,\nbring in external resources, and manipulate the appearances of the text, such as\nthe layout and font properties. In the FRBR model, these are changes that define\nnew manifestations of the text, implying that digital users continuously create\nnew momentary expressions of the original work.\n\nAs the above discussion indicates, neither the FRBR model nor the traditional\ndefinitions of “text” are very well suited to categorize or describe digital texts,\na fact clearly illustrating that as far as important basic features are concerned,\ndigital texts are very different from texts conveyed by physical items, such as\nmanuscripts and printed books.

When historical texts are remediated and studied within this\nnew text paradigm, researchers necessarily have to ask, with Roger Chartier,\nif the text they are studying is still the same.\n\nAs Odd Einar Haugen and Daniel Apollon explain in chapter 1, the emerging\ndigital textual scholarship may be understood from the perspectives of textual\neditors looking backward, outward, or inward. “Looking backward” means to\nsearch for the origin of a text and to trace its development. In a classical setting it\nmeans to track the process of copying from the very original and then from one\nexemplar to the next, and in a post-Gutenberg setting, to trace the development\nfrom the first drafts made by the author until the printed end product. “Look-\ning outward” means to view the text as a socichistorically situated product, and\n“looking inward” implies reading and understanding the text as an individual\nexpression of its own right, as a self-contained document. Evidently, many of\nthe research questions related to these perspectives are intrinsically tied to basic\ncharacteristics of written or printed text, such as the physical materiality of the\ntext, its object status, fixedness, durability, the authors’ integrity, and the unity\nof the work. When the object of study—the text itself—changes as a result of\nremediation, taking on a range of new features, researchers also have to ask if\nthe traditional research problems are still relevant. Contending that the research\nquestions are still valid, as a minimum requirement, researchers have to clarify\nthe relation between the object that is studied, the digital text, and the original\nhistorical text the study is supposed to illuminate. This is absolutely critical,\nbecause text is by no means a dead object but permeated with meaning and\nbasically defined by its interpretation. Following the fact that texts are given\nnew basic features, at a basic interpretative level, digital remediation of text\nencourages new ways of reading and new reading practices, inevitably raising\nquestions of how these new practices influence the interpretation of historical\ntexts when presented in digital environments.\n\nRemediation or Revolution in Reading Practices?\n\nThe word “revolution” can sound a bit far-fetched for talking about reading, but\nit is a fact that in the last fifteen years many researchers, such as Sven Birkerts\n(1994), Roger Chartier and his Le Livre en révolutions (1997), George Landow\n(2006), or Maryanne Wolf (2008), have drawn attention to the important trans-\nformations affecting not only texts, written works, but more specifically the\nwriting and reading mind.

Eco is referring\nhere to successive inventions, such as photography or cinema, that have changed\nthe process of artistic representation. These cultural changes do not happen\novernight but take a long time to become pervasive and result in developments\nnot necessarily foreseen or predicted. Because the effects of digital technology\non reading have already become a hotly debated issue, it is not premature to\nconsider if the new practices represent a real threat to humanistic values and the\nreading brain or if they herald a new era of novel thoughts, creative thinking,\nand a new democratic relation to reading and writing.\n\nIn the first part of this chapter, scholarly editions were revisited with a view\nof challenging the prophecy of newness that digital technology carries for the\nstudy of texts by reinterpreting as a process of remediation the changes duly\nexperienced by editors in going from paper to digital technology. This has made\nevident that the contents of the new media are closely linked to their predeces-\nsors, as they pay tribute to the same intellectual, literary, and historical prin-\nciples. It has also brought forth the fact that these contents were themselves often\nthe result of earlier remediation from other media representation. Remediation\ncan thus largely account for the value added to existing scholarly editions when\nthey are transposed from one media to another, or also attributed to digitally\nnative editions, which, although developed with digital tools, follow existing\nprinted work requirements.\n\nBut it has also been shown that the original texts acquire new features be-\ncause of remediation; it is not the same objects that the researchers interact\nwith, nor the same tools, and this opens the domain to new and fruitful re-\nsearch questions and the possible emergence of a new scientific paradigm. In\nthis second part of the chapter, reading practices are reviewed in the light of\nnot only the remediation process but also of the new digital reading modalities\nand the new relationships to texts and knowledge that are dawning with the\ndevelopment of digital technologies.

Our argument here\nis based on confronting what constitutes the digital practices of reading today\nwith the enduring representations of reading developed in reference to reading\non paper and by looking at how digital critical editions can meet the expecta-\ntions and demands of readers and their multiform, multitasking, multimedia\nreading in a digital world.\n\nScience fiction author and media theory professor Paul Levinson (1998) has\ndefined remediation as the “anthropotropic” (anthropo-” for “human” and\n“tropic” for “toward”) process by which new media technologies improve upon\nor remedy prior technologies in their rendering of human performance. As\nreaders go from paper to digital, the challenge in transposing the remediation\nconcept is to assess if digital reading does offer improved conditions for reading\nand how new media develop their cultural acceptance and significance. Accord-\ning to Bolter (2000), as referred to in the first part of this chapter, remediation\nmore specifically characterizes the way in which new media refashion earlier\nmedia forms. The two main strategies of remediation are immediacy or trans-\nparency (trying to make the viewer forget the presence of the medium) and\nhypermediacy or opacity (trying to multiply mediation so as to create a feeling\nof fullness, a satiety of experience, an excess of media). When considering read-\ning, can such strategies help to understand what is at stake? Immediacy would\nbe what qualifies uninterrupted reading, an immersive experience of being\ninvolved in a narrative such that both decoding and page turning become trans-\nparent. The opposite of this, hypermediacy, applies quite aptly to the reading of\nscholarly works, where the critical apparatus, the variants, and the annotated\ntext constantly converge to inform and convince the reader that he is accessing\nthe complete and authentic meaning or interpretation of the text of document\nthrough an augmented version of the original document.\n\nHowever, if applying the remediation strategies to reading is to shed suf-\nficient light on the changes in reading, much deeper transformations must be\ntaken into account.

One\nneeds to take into consideration the changes that the digital world brings to\nthe social representations, the professional constraints, and the cultural crite-\nria that organize one’s reading experience. As reading practices become more\ncomplex and diversified, scholars need to ensure that the digitization of their\ntexts, manuscripts, and diverse sources of contents are not only compatible\nwith the new capabilities, expectations, research criteria, and competences of\ntheir intended readers but are also capable of bringing about authentic cultural\nexperiences worthy of the works presented.\n\nThe End of Reading as an Experience of Interiority?\n\nFor centuries, reading has been the core cultural activity of Western culture,\nand the book has been seen as “modernity’s quintessential technology—‘a\nmeans of transportation through the space of experience, at the speed of a\nturning page,” as the poet Joseph Brodsky puts it (Rosen 2008). For university\nprofessor Nathalie Piégay-Gros (2002), “Reading is an activity comparable to\ninterpreting a musical score” (15; our translation). Well-known testimonies put\nreading as the source of interiority, intellectual awakening, self-construction,\nand pure enjoyment of life. Reading can be the lifeline of the solitary child, as\ndescribed by Alberto Manguel (1996): “Sitting at my desk, elbows on the page,\nchin on my hands, abstracted for a moment from the changing light outside\nand the sounds that rise from the street, I am seeing, listening to, following\n(but these words don’t do justice to what is taking place within me) a story, a\ndescription, an argument. Nothing moves except my eyes and my hand oc-\ncasionally turning a page, and yet something not exactly defined by the word\n“text” unfurls, progresses, grows and takes root as I read” (28). These lines stand\nin echo of Proust’s (2971) well-known “praise of reading? in a text beginning\nwith “There are perhaps no days of our childhood we lived so fully as those\nwe believe we left without having lived them, those we spent with a favorite\nbook. Describing his experiences of reading during his personal childhood,\nProust has strong metaphors as he presents reading as both a “fiery and sedate\nbliss” (2000, 73), “this contract with other minds” (61), “this pure and calm\nfriendship” (56), or “this divine pleasure” (7; our translations).\n\nThis dominant reference to printed books in the reading experience comes\nwith a preferred reading object: literature. Reading fictional or poetic texts has\nlong been the prototypical reading experience, as least in the Western world.\nBased on attention and concentration, intense and intentional reading, espe-\ncially in the case of literary texts, is still largely the dominant representation of\n\n   \n\f"

Literature is credited with feeding concentrated and refined\nemotions, desires, and knowledge that are aroused in a reading experience:\n\nFor literature remains the unexcelled means of interior exploration and connec-\ntion-making. The whole art—fiction, poetry, and drama—is fundamentally pledged\nto coherence, not just in terms of contents, but in forms as well. (Birkerts 1994, 197)\n\nLiterature in particular, in all its forms (myths and legends, fairy tales, poems,\nnovels, theatre, personal journals, comics, albums, essays—as long as it’s “writ-\nten’), offers a remarkable medium to awaken interiority, put thought in movement,\nstimulate symbolic activity, meaning construction, and foster seminal sharings.\n(Petit 2008, 224)\n\nHence there is an importance that is attributed to investing in texts, developing\nreading as a pleasurable experience and as an emotional and aesthetic encounter.\nThis vision of reading has recently been brought into perspective by ethnolo-\ngists who underline that this understanding of reading, as an individual activity\nfocused on an experience of interiority, is basically a Western approach within a\nspecific historical time span. Brian Stock pleads for opening up the concept of\nreading: “The only way to move beyond the limits of our present understand-\ning is to expand the archive of known reading practices; and this knowledge is\nperhaps the best guarantee that contemporary practices will not be made the\nstandard for evaluating the different roles that reading plays elsewhere” (1993,\n271). For, according to this ethnologist, “It is likewise recognized by historians\nand anthropologists that the notion of literature, as a type of discourse acces-\nsible through reading written texts for their nonvisible, allegorical, or spiritual\nsignificance, is largely a Western invention. The implied connection between\nwritings and inner realities since Plato is one of the successful fictions that\nantiquity and the Middle Ages perpetrated on the modern world? (272).\n\nA historian of intellectual practices such as Christian Jacob also relativizes the\nimportance of individual reading: “Silent and solitary reading is only one mo-\ndality amongst others, that has developed because of the emergence of intimate\nspaces and a personal relation to books and literature, and of the acknowledge-\nment of individual subjectivity and sensitivity, fashioned by the evolution of\nsociety, customs and education” (2003, 18~19; our translation).\n\nThese historical perspectives are introduced here because they provide\na distance that is necessary in order to understand the ongoing changes in\nreading practices with the development of digital means. For in our culture,\nreading is so deeply fashioned by the paper book that it is difficult to think\notherwise of reading, or at least to think in terms of legitimate and worthy\nmodalities that do not rest on the use of paper and whose implicit model is\nnot literary reading.\n\n   \n\f"

Volumens and codices\nyesterday, paper books today, as well as all digital reading devices, are part of\nthe cultural technologies that help us relate to information, knowledge, and,\nmore generally, to texts and documents.\n\nWhat the advent of digital technology has brought about is not only a differ-\nentiation between texts and their material support but also a strong awareness of\nthe collusion between print, text, and thinking processes. Because printing and\nbooks are technologies, and because “technology constitutes a crucial cultural\nforce” (Landow 2006, 46), it is necessary to consider the development of digital\ntechnology not as an alien product intruding in a natural setting but as a continu-\ning evolution and expansion of information technology. George Landow explains\nhow each technology has a tendency to consistently affect its inner principles,\nwhich allow for a limited number of tendencies, even though it is not possible\nto determine the exact directions that this influence will take.\n\nTransposing written texts from paper to digital forms has led to the aware-\nness that many characteristics attributed to knowledge were in fact primar-\nily characteristics of print, such as stable spelling; rigorous punctuation; and\naccurate, permanent, and structured texts. When one thinks of reading, it\nis usually an in-depth, solitary experience of interacting with text on paper.\nThat's because the dominant representation of reading is intertwined with the\nrepresentation of printed texts in books and most of our reading experiences\nhave been with printed books.\n\nAnother awareness that the transfer brings about is the importance of form\nin grasping the meaning of texts. Don McKenzie (1991), Oxford bibliographer\nand text sociologist, conceived that the role of the bibliographer is to “show\nthat the forms have an impact on meaning” (30). Christian Jacob, a historian\nof intellectual practices, addresses a similar issue when he writes: “The mate-\nriality of books and the constraints in their handling affect the modalities of\ntext appropriation, the process of meaning construction, and this applies to all\nbooks, be they manuscripts, printed or displayed on a computer screen” (1996,\n56). In other words, the reception of a text is conditioned by the form that has\nbeen given to it, because the material support, the graphical presentation, and\nthe means of access will all affect the interpretative process, from connoting\nin certain ways the author, the text, the authority of the text, the importance\nof the text, the way of reading the text, and so on. The importance of the form\nfor a text also stems from the strong emotional investments that most readers\nplace in books as personal and valuable objects.\n\nAs historians have shown, because technology affects meaning construction,\ncharacteristics of texts came to be identified with the printed book. Not only did\npage layouts and composition reach a summit of readability with print settings,\n\n   \n\f"

Paper printing gradually imposed a stabilized text, a page setup facili-\ntating eye movements across the text, silent reading, and editorial references\nthat legitimized documents. The use of specific presentation features, such as\nchunking text into paragraphs, highlighting titles and subtitles, using italics and\npage display, and providing blanks and margins, affects content composition,\nwhich in turn induces cognitive processes.\n\nScholarly Reading: A Case on Its Own?\n\nReading old texts and critical editions of heritage works corresponds to a par-\nticular modality of reading called scholarly or erudite reading. This reading mode\ncomprises a certain number of features that correspond to ways of interacting\nwith such texts and to the fact that this type of reading is usually associated with\nworking on texts. Until recently, scholarly editions have been produced basically\nas printed books, and most of the researchers using digital tools for their work still\nproduce paper editions as their final output. Consequently, scholarly or erudite\nreading refers to reading paper works. Is the reading of these works threatened,\nand will the heralded changes in reading practices apply to scholarly reading?\n\nJacob has pertinently analyzed this scholarly reading mode, distinguishing it\nclearly from ordinary reading: “Reading refers today to a kind of well-regulated\nsolitary and silent relationship to writing, the dynamic encounter between two\nsubjectivities, between two intentionalities, through the mediation of a written\ntext that would have the identification and projection power of a mirror. This\nmodel is only one step in a long evolution, during which not only the nature\nand status of books, but also their uses and their handling have considerably\nvaried” (Jacob 2003, 18). Unlike this reading mode, scholarly reading is defined\nas “the activity of those who handle books as deposits, knowledge, wisdom and\nmeaning objects or instruments. This knowledge, this wisdom and this meaning\nitself, presumed inscribed within the text, are actualized as results of reading,\nas the fruits of work, as the production of watchful eyes, of attention and of\nintelligence” (20). Not only is scholarly reading closely associated with paper\nbooks, but it also favors a reading mode made possible through the existence\nof this type of books. “Reflexivity seems to us to be an essential dimension of\nthis activity: the scholarly reader controls and modulates his practice, he orients\nand focuses his look, he exploits the text and his very reading” (21).\n\nFor scholarly reading is above all “slow and methodical, aiming at an in-depth\nunderstanding of the document itself” (Jacob 1987, 89). Often linked to writing\nand working on the texts, “learned reading is defined by specific protocols: the\nreader interposes between the text and himself grids or filters, in order to select\ndata and impose a specific point of view on the text” (Jacob 2003, 21-22).

Even if there is an awareness of the\nfacilitating possibilities of digital means for readers, it appears that the digital\neditions are still conceived as very similar to literary reading on paper.\n\nThe Paper Paradigm Still Largely Organizes\nthe Reading Experience\n\nUntil recently, hardly anybody outside the concerned Western scholars was\naware of how important printing and paper had become for reading and con-\nception of text. By the “paper paradigm’ of reading we are referring to the set of\nassumptions, representations, and practices that have coalesced with the devel-\nopment of printing on paper. Therefore, the term “paradigm” is to be understood\nwithin the perspective brought by Thomas Kuhn as “the entire constellation of\nbeliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared by the members of a given com-\nmunity” (1962, 175). With this concept, Kuhn introduced a rupture in the history\nof sciences, in conceiving it not as an accumulation of knowledge but as a series\nof revolutionary breaks, as a “succession of tradition-bound periods punctu-\nated by non-cumulative breaks” (208). What the paper paradigm emphasizes\nis the quasi-irreversible connection between reading and paper books, which,\nbecause of their fixity, their recognized legitimacy, and their user friendliness,\nhave become irreplaceable for sustaining the experience of comprehension, of\nconcentration, of interiority, and of memorization that reading is believed to\nrequire. That is why, inasmuch as the paper page layout, the fractioning of texts,\nand their typography can be reproduced onscreen, the experience of digital\nreading can take place within a certain continuity and can be considered as a\nremediation of the practice and not a revolution.\n\nOur dominant representation of reading is based on the printed book. When\nreaders are asked what they want to read on, most will say they want it to be like\npaper. Sometimes readers do not even think they have read something unless\nthey have read it on paper. When questioned after reading e-books, readers\nsay that what they missed the most is “the feeling of paper.’ Not being able to\nfeel and turn the pages deprived them of the feeling of progress in reading.\nWithout page turning many people feel they no longer have a hold on their\nreading experience, because they don’t have a sense of how far they've gone.\nHigh screen resolutions are appreciated inasmuch as they come close to the\nhigh quality of print norms.

When one\nreads as the title of a conference “The Death of the Book,’ the speaker is probably\nreferring only to the death of the paper book. It is urgent to develop awareness\nof this paper paradigm in order to better understand the cultural changes that\nare taking place today.\n\nAdolescents today have not left aside the paper experience, as evidenced\nby the sales figures of different novels geared to teenagers: 11 million copies of\nHarry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, by J. K. Rowling, had been sold in July\n2007 within the first twenty-four hours of sale, and the number of books sold in\nthe Harry Potter series was already at 325 million even before the seventh, and\nfinal, novel came out (BBC World News, July 23, 2007). The Twilight series of\nfour best-selling novels (with a combined page count of over two thousand) by\nStephanie Meyer also had record sales of 42 million copies four years after the\nfirst book went on sale. Whether this is a passing flurry or a real discovery for\nteenagers and the younger adults who compose the readership, their reading\nexperience as an exploration of fantasy, witchcraft, and imaginary characters is\nnow intensively being attended to by a large number of authors. What this mass\npopularity of printed books confirms is the need to closely examine whether\nreading is changing or whether reading practices are becoming more diversified,\ndifferent, and distinctive.\n\nSven Birkerts, back in 1994, made a strong case for the printed text-based\ninteriority experience, which he then considered as being specifically tied to\nthe reading of printed books. He observed with dismay the new experience of\ndigital reading as surface oriented, faster, and less engaging in opposition to this\nWestern printed book experience. The conflict he described was reminiscent of\nsimilar fears that were voiced in the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, when\npeople started reading faster, because, among other reasons, print is read faster\nthan manuscripts. But such fears have often been expressed throughout the\nhistory of reading as practices moved from the meditative, prayer-like reading\nof texts in the Middle Ages to the skimming and diagonal reading of twenty-\nfirst-century readers.\n\nAlthough Birkerts has now moved into the digital workplace, he stresses the\nfact that there are “profound discontinuities in what we optimistically call the\nevolution of culture,’ and he stresses the need today “to orient ourselves to the\nnew, its possibilities as well as its liabilities”\n\f"

What’s more, much of the transfer has been in the\ndirection of ease. To add exponentially increased processing power to a computer,\nnew enabling software packages; to acquire a mobile phone or access to fifty new\nchannels—these feel like expansions and augmentations, and we take them in our\nstride, one by one, mostly unaware that we embed ourselves ever more deeply in\na mesh. And unaware, too, that at a certain point that embeddedness is compre-\nhensive enough to mark a significant change in our way of living. It is necessary\nto grasp this fact of saturation if any headway is to be made in understanding the\npresent situation. (Birkerts 2003)\n\nIn fact, the changes in reading practices are not so much a question of technology\nas a question of social practices. It is the users who decide ifand when the new\npractices are preferable and if and for what reason the old ones should survive.\n\nChanges in Reading as Symptoms\n\nChanges happening with digital information technologies today are being dis-\ncussed either to raise concern or to stimulate adoption. Non-biased facts are\ndifficult to come across, and therefore the issues can be raised mainly in terms of\nquestions asked. Different media are relaying a general alert concerning explicit\nchanges in reading. Reading on screens is held responsible for shortening our\nattention spans and for reducing reading to just-in-time skimming, to scan-\nning material very quickly (Marshall 2004), to processing smaller and smailer\nsnippets of text. Is reading on screens putting an end to reading in depth (Levy\n2001), dissolving disciplinary boundaries, weakening our ability to think things\nthrough for ourselves (Sanger 2008), radically changing public and private space,\nand destroying the isolation of distance? Of course, these questions do not stem\nspecifically from digital scholarly practices, because the presentations of most\ndigital scholarly editions are very similar to their paper ancestors. But it can be\nassumed that if these changes in reading habits are established, they will gradu-\nally concern all readers and, consequently, digital scholarly editors will need to\nbe aware of the kind of readers their works will be addressing.\n\nIna seminal article with the provocative title “Is Google Making Us Stupid?”\nwhich resonated all across the Western hemisphere in the summer of 2008,\njournalist Nicholas Carr formulated the problem with digital technology as\nbeing related to the shaping of the mind by the tools used, Google being the\nmost terrifying. This shaping had previously been described as becoming in-\ncapable of dense, in-depth reading and capable only of surfing across the web\nwith only short spans of reading.

Google’s declared mission, “to organize the\nworld’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.’ as stated on\ntheir website, coupled with their interest in artificial intelligence, does not really\nreassure him.\n\nCarr also refers to Maryanne Wolf’s book on reading as a reorganization of\nneuronal circuits, in order to understand the ongoing changes in the brain due to\ndigital activity. For Wolf there is cause for alarm: “We must be vigilant not to lose\nthe profound generativity of the reading brain as we add new dimensions to our\nintellectual repertoire” (M. Wolf 2008, 23). The “partial attention” culture that is\ntypical of Internet browsing and multitasking could foster information illiteracy.\n\nEven though most people are aware of differences in their use of the Internet\nand of paper books, they are often unable to identify or explain these differences\nand often have a feeling that digital technology does not provide for reading\nactivities that are as engaging and in-depth as reading paper books. Therefore,\nthey are genuinely questioning whether digital uses are developing new cultural\ngrounds, attitudes, and perspectives and doing away with strongly established\nand precious values.\n\nWhat this brings home is that culture in a digital world is not primarily based\non or referring to books. We are probably in the midst ofa shockwave equivalent\nto the one the printing press initiated in the sixteenth century, as documented\nby historians such as Guglielmo Cavallo and Roger Chartier (1997) or Elisabeth\nEisenstein (1983). For in addition to providing a new support for text, printing\nchanged the hierarchy of information production and the communication cir-\ncuits in fundamental ways. The sixteenth century saw not only the development\nof print but also the rise of the Renaissance, of the Reform, and of humanism.\n“Within decades, a new intellectual community was fashioning and feeding\nthe Renaissance, that sudden and dynamic expansion of Western culture that\ndared to transgress the margins of medievalism’ (Fischer 2003, 206). “Printing’s\nemancipation of the written word defined that essential dynamic of our modern\nworld, the accelerated accessing of information” (207). And as the French histo-\nrian Henri-Jean Martin has reminded us, “The gradual shift from the world of\norality to the society of writing .. . led, in the final analysis, to something quite\nnew—the unleashing of mechanisms that prompted a new view of self and a\nspirit of abstraction . . . It encouraged a logic of the act as well as a logic of the\nword, and also an ability to reach reasoned decisions and a higher measure of\nself-control!” (Martin 1996, 321, as quoted by Fischer 2003, 207).

As the different media—photography, film, radio, comic\nstrips, press, and television—have developed in the last century, cultural prac-\ntices have experienced important changes and reading on paper has become\nseriously challenged as the main enriching pastime. While some sociologists\nkeep stressing the general stupefying effect of media on masses, most users\nhave not simply passively adapted to the different media but have learned to\nread ingenious magazine layouts; to zap commercials and uninteresting TV\n\n \n\nprograms; and to find their own personal preferences and gems in the profusion\nof games, shows, and activities that media have made available.\n\nWhat characterizes the digital reading paradigm can be drawn from the\nbehaviors already considered as typical of a digital world.

These tools can be personalized and are geared\nmainly to communication. The user is not a viewer or a listener but an actor,\nintervening in the flow of data that relates him to the world through a digital\ndevice. Whether it’s through a game, a commercial transaction, or a search for\ninformation, the Internet user is constantly picking up information, making\ndecisions, and intervening in the unfolding of the action. This also applies to\nreading on screens, as computers were not designed for continuous reading but\nfor reading and writing. This basically active approach is coupled with an un-\nreserved and open approach to documents and information, with an authentic\nbelief that mediators and intermediaries are superfluous. A good example of\nthis belief is the use of encyclopedias like Wikipedia, where users are confident\nthat they can understand the explanations and presentations, whatever the topic,\nwhich is not the case with the authoritative encyclopedias such as Britannica\nor Universalis. This is coupled with a renewed faith in democracy and sharing,\nas exemplified by the social networks that have been set up and the extreme\nconfidence with which people share their lives, their aspirations, their feelings,\nand their daily activities with their friends, usually, but also with total strangers.\n\nDigital tools allow readers to explore new reading modalities: fine textual\ninvestigation with analytical tools, and instant hypothesis testing with tools\nfor translating, researching, clustering, classifying, synthesizing. These are im-\nportant challenges for trailblazers. There is a need to deconstruct the reading\nconcept and construct new reception schemas. Second-generation e-book users\neasily expressed in a survey (Bélisle et al. 2004a) their new requirements as they\nbecame familiar with the possibilities of the e-book devices they were using\nfor reading. They wanted new features, such as more contextual information,\ndictionaries, and Internet access. Thus, because they were working with a digital\ntool that offered potentially numerous possibilities, they were modifying their\nreading habits, even for reading novels. It is obvious to foresee that evolving\nreading practices will rapidly impose new interfaces and new content concepts,\nsuch as “collections?” which could have an important role in organizing access,\nwhile the distribution in book units seems less pertinent in a digital context.\nThose who are leading the way in reading technology will find stimulating\nchallenges in mastering these tools.\n\nThe first generation of e-books, the handheld reading devices, which almost\nmade it to popularity at the end of the twentieth century, gained their appeal\nthrough their printed-book-like presentation of text, answering readers’ expecta-\ntions of legibility in bringing printing norms into the digital world.

For them, “knowing\nhow” is more important than “knowing what, and knowing how comes with\npractice and with participation in a community of practice as well as sharing\nits ways of seeing, understanding, interpreting, and acting.\n\nAs Marc Prensky has stressed for the last decade, “Today's students think\nand process information fundamentally differently from their predecessors”\nas a result of their immersion in a digital technology environment and the\n“sheer volume of their interaction” (2001) within it. Surveys, for example, at\nthe European University of Bretagne (Henriet, Malingre, and Serres 2008) or at\nthe British Library (Williams and Rowlands 2007), show that there is a general\nlow level of competence in working with documents. At the same time, the\nresearchers were baffled by the gap between what they were expecting as far as\nroutines and attitudes in coherence with the students’ university training, and\nthe actual behaviors of the users. For example, the “Google generation” (Google\nwas created in 1998) prefers rapid information, already summarized, and is not\ninterested in format nor in the original support that would have allowed users\nto contextualize the information found.\n\nIt is not that the “digital natives” are more or less competent in searching for\ninformation than previous students (this is what interests teachers); it is that\nthey are not looking with the same criteria and not appreciating what they find\nwith the same values. There is still very little information on this difference in\nprocessing information, but it does appear that digital natives have a more de-\ntached and functional relation to texts and meaning. Texts and documents are\nmeans to interact with the world and are not immediately the basic witnesses\nof civilization, to be revered and preserved.

How can the work\non critical editions take into account these evolutions in order to ensure that\nthese publications are present in a world of digital knowledge?\n\nMore Information and Less Structure\n\nTwo basic changes in the way readers relate to information are brought about\nby digital technology: (1) the access to vast quantities of information, which\nhas led to the involvement of intermediary software in reading, and (2) the\nemergence of new and evolving information structures.The first change in-\nvolves the well-known and researched explosive increase and facilitation in\naccessing information and the resulting information overload for the user.\nDigital devices such as computers (portable or desktop), cellular phones, or\ndigital offers such as online libraries or websites provide more and more\ninformation and access to different types of resources: not only texts and im-\nages but also newspapers, journals, radio and television podcasts, raw data\ncoming in from existing databases, or online recordings of remote sensors\nin real time (for example, those used by the European space station or the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration). These offers also include\naccess to rare and fragile materials—for example, medieval manuscripts—but\nalso multilingual information software (e.g., translation of a Japanese text for\nWestern readers—not the same as if you were really reading Japanese, but still\nsomething that breaks the barrier). Accessing digital resources also means\nchanges in the way people learn; as can be observed over the last ten years,\nthe thrust is not so much in memorizing sciences such as physics, history, or\ngeography but in providing students with opportunities to engage in scientific\ninquiry, in comparative understanding, or in documented presentations. This\nsituation has given rise to a new category of tools: search engines, now well\nknown through the problematic success of Google. Searches are performed\nin an ocean of information, with results that can be staggering; millions of\nlinks may be signaled, but usually the first dozen references are sufficiently\npertinent to satisfy the user.\n\nThe second basic change in how readers relate to technology is the dimension\nof information structuring. This fundamental change is much less spectacular\nbut probably entails more crucial consequences for reading processes and prac-\ntices. The disciplinary structured information is decreasing proportionately as\nmore and more diversely structured information becomes accessible online,\nwhether because of the formats such as databases or because of the content\nsuch as multimedia, multilingual, and multicultural documents and files.\n\n   \n\f"

While information research on paper sources is usually\ncarried out within a disciplinary approach of knowledge, the use of digital\nsupport favors a more contextualized, thematic, and personalized approach\nbased on dynamic searching, editing, and publishing.

Fur-\nthermore, there are two major flaws that hinder the reader's interaction with\ndigital editions. The first one is the multiplicity of “isolated and incompatible\nplatform-dependent” (Shillingsburg 2006) systems, each providing “at least one\nunique capability not found in the others” (90) and each requiring from the\nuser a significant investment to master the intricacies of its tools. The second\ndrawback is the lack of assured conversion tools; as technological systems are\nconstantly developing and being updated, it is not acceptable that a critical edi-\ntion produced in year n will no longer be accessible with the technology of year\nnti or n+2. Therefore two obvious demands must be met for scholars, other\nthan a few pioneers, to embrace digital critical editions: (1) an interface (or a\nbrowser) that provides integrated or built-in access to the main tools necessary\nto attend to the needs of the different script acts that scholars choose to engage\nin, and (2) a file format that ensures easy conversion and updating, compatible\nwith user-friendly reading and writing tools.\n\nIf these serious technological deterrents can be overcome, can digital editions\nreplace paper editions? Up to now readers’ opinions did not have much weight in\ndecisions concerning editing of scholarly works. By implicit consensus these edi-\ntions could be produced—and can still be produced—without any consideration\nfor readers and can even end up without having any actual readers. The goal of\nthese editions is to arrive at a recognized and established text, with the double\naim of conservation and authenticity. As librarians have observed, readers who\nare not scholars but are nevertheless interested in ancient manuscripts, books,\nor texts generally ask to have access to documents they can understand, and\nthis might mean not necessarily the originals but versions in modern fonts and\nspelling. These two aims, scholarly and amateur, do not necessarily converge.\n\nReaders of historic texts do not discredit the different academic disputes over\nwhat constitutes textuality, but it is most often of no use to these readers to enter\ninto such nuances, because they do not usually have the background to have a\ncritical understanding of the issues addressed. Unless it is decided that critical\neditions are aimed only at the small population of students and researchers\ncognizant of the works edited, it is necessary to rethink the editorial objectives\nof critical editions in the light of reader expectations and needs. Furthermore,\nthe digital representation of texts is bringing about new reading and critical\nanalysis strategies. As digital representation alters the conditions of textuality,\nmaking it possible for readers to pursue new and diversified goals, editors must\nprovide readers with alternative approaches and paths.\n\n   \n\f"

They do not ignore the\ncumulative nature of scholarship, nor do they necessarily dismiss the proofs\nof scientificity that the critical apparatus provides. But very few will seek a\n“definitive” text. Their questions do not address claims of truth and author-\nity, or reliability, or completeness of an edited work. Readers are interested in\nknowing clearly and rapidly what are the contents of a work; they also want\nnavigation tools that allow freedom of movement, browsing, and examina-\ntion, tools that facilitate critical and associative reading by the user through\nthe use of hyperlinks.\n\nEditors present the text for reflexive and critical readers as if these readers\nwant to read the entire text or work in depth. However, because of the evolv-\ning way of researching information, readers will increasingly want to be able\nto choose, to read only parts, and to pursue a text only if they find interest in\nwhat is being read. There may be a basic dissymmetry between reader and pro-\nducer of digital editions: producers want to present the final complete version,\nwhereas readers want to access segments of a text, depending on the objectives\nof their search. It is interesting to observe that a library such as the New York\nMunicipal Library has undertaken to completely overhaul its online catalog in\norder to attend to the developing digital experience of those users who want to\naccess only chapters, extracts, or parts of works.\n\nTaking into account the increased differentiation between reading practices,\nwhich can already be observed, the main issue is what new possibilities digital\ntechnology brings for discovering, understanding, and interpreting scholarly\neditions of literary works.

An old-fashioned\nuniversity professor is today incapable of reading a computer screen at the same\nspeed as a teenager” (297). This is usually seen as a problem because professors\ntypically refer to only one representation of reading: intensive, repetitious read-\ning—ultimately the religious practice of holy texts meditation. It is a constant\nobservation in the history of reading that each important change in reading\nmodalities, reading publics, and reading sources has seen acceleration in the\nreading rhythm.\n\nThe Unresolved Ambitions of Digital\nCritical Editions\n\nIn order to develop beyond a smail circle of erudite professors and students,\ndigital scholarly editions have to address a public wider than disciples, those\nwho abide by the discipline, who appreciate conforming to academic norms.\nWith the renewed interest in heritage, multiculturalism, and in humanities\ngenerally, there is probably a very large potential public for scholarly editions,\nbut before this public is attended to or reached, critical editors must rethink\nhow to present what they have to offer.\n\nThe main issue is what new possibilities for discovering, understanding,\nand interpreting scholarly editions of literary works that digital technology\ncan bring. Editors need to reconcile themselves with the fact that users will be\nlooking at their productions in significantly different ways than those provided\nuntil now. Users access texts to find information with very different objectives,\nfrom participating in a media contest to writing one’s thesis. Documents in\ncritical editions can be consulted only partially, sometimes very rapidly, and\noften with processing tools such as search engines, translators, annotators,\nmetadata harvesters, and so on. It is up to critical editors to develop access to\ntheir material if they want their production to be part of the continuing cultural\nheritage and therefore accessible by most digital tools used for interacting with\nthis heritage today.\n\nAmbitious prospects for critical editions are not new. As early as 1991, Jay\nBolter was already explaining how the electronic (one would now say digital)\nspace held unsuspected promises that could be attained by moving humanistic\nstudy to the computer.

Hailing the\nelectronic library as a “new republic of letters; he saw the computer as making\n“the seductive promise to break down the barrier between thought and writing,\nto join the mind and writing surface into a seamless whole” (206).\n\nThese promising outlooks for critical digital editions have been tested to\nsome degree over the years. Today a much more complex understanding of the\ndigital possibilities prevails. Important changes are under way in the world of\nscholarly edition. As Peter Shillingsburg summarizes it:\n\nTextual critics [... ] discovered that texts were more than simply correct or er-\nroneous. Textual shape was in flux, affected by authorial revision and by the acts\nof editors meeting new needs: new target audiences, censorship, and the tastes of\nnew times. Tracing the history of these textual changes and their various cultural\nimplications became an activity parallel to that of literary critics pursuing new\nways to (mis)read texts. Taking into account these important evolutions in the\ndiscipline, researchers are gradually acknowledging that constructing a scholarly\nedition has now gone beyond the capacities of print technology, making it more\nand more inescapable that scholarly editions should be constructed and published\nelectronically. (2006, 81)\n\nIn fact, there are good reasons that explain why scholars have not been per-\nsuaded of the advances that digital editions can embody. A number of drawbacks\nhave severely hampered the digital turnover. As has been shown in other digital\nareas, users will adopt only technology that is user-friendly, that does not require\nan investment considered outrageous in the light of the gains achieved, that does\nnot entail an important deviation from one’s course of action, and that provides\ngreater satisfaction through peer recognition or social status enhancement.\nThis is still not the case with digital critical editions. The work undertaken by\ndifferent scholars has produced an array of tools, most of them requiring their\nown system, installment, and work method. This results in tools that are not\neasily mastered, even for prospective digital native readers, and for scholars it\nsignals a real challenge still to be met of putting scholarly editions at the level\nof readers’ expectations.\n\nDigital space does seem particularly challenging for scholarly editing. It\nconstitutes a medium that is capable of meeting readers’ expectations through\nrepresenting different versions of a work and the complex relationships be-\ntween them through hyperlinking and multiple window and multitasking in-\nterfaces. However, how exactly these interactive navigational expectations can\nbe met is still highly unspecified. Digital editions can also answer readers’ new\n\n   \n\f"

Visions of Digital\nEditions\n\nJonas Carlquist\nUniversity of Umeda, Sweden\n\nAbstract\n\nHow was a medieval manuscript meant to be read? This is a question that has\nconcerned me for a long time in my work with Old Swedish manuscripts from\nVadstena Abbey. In many manuscripts we can find traces of the historical read-\ning situation; for example, pointing hands, marginal notes, etc. Such signals had\nan important function for the medieval reader, but they are rarely put forward\nin modern printed editions. I maintain that many of these paratextual notes can\nbe explained with the help of hypertext theory, and be emphasized in a digital\nedition. I discuss this possibility by giving some examples from Scandinavian\ncomposite manuscripts. 1 show how digital technology together with new\nphilological theory can give new life to medieval manuscripts, as digital editions\ntogether with the use of linking give the modern reader a deeper understanding\nof manuscript culture. This is possible because new philology revalues the\nconcrete textual witnesses of a manuscript and takes each single version of a text\ninto discussion. A printed edition is a much too clumsy tool if the aim is to give\nthe modern reader a clear view of the uses of manuscript during the Middle\nAges, but with digital technology an edition can be more complete by applying\ndifferent layers of information.\n\n   \n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn this paper I would like to discuss in what manner composite\nmanuscripts from the Middle Ages were meant to be read. As a researcher\nof Scandinavian philology my starting point is the Nordic material that in\n\n \n\n  \n\nCorrespondence: some way differs from continental material such as Latin and Anglo-\nJonas Carlquist, Saxon manuscripts.

There might herein lie a comparison with\nhypertext and multisequential reading. If medieval manuscripts—\nespecially composite manuscripts—were meant to be read in a multi-\nsequential order, digital technology might make it possible to revive the\ndifferent possibilities of reception structure in a way that paperbound\neditions cannot do. When paperbound editions of composite manu-\nscripts are rather difficult to penetrate from a receptional point of view,\ndigital editions may pave the way for modern readers to perceive com-\nposite manuscripts from a medieval perspective. The use of digital media\ncan give new life to the field of philology.’ This is something that is dis-\ncussed throughout the paper. In the conclusions I will present my own\nview on how digital editing promises to be a powerful tool for phil-\nologists of today, in particular those who study along the lines of what is\ncalled ‘new philology’ (for more on the term, see below; see also Nichols\n(1990) or Gle&gen and Lebsanft (1997)).\n\n2 What Does a Medieval Manuscript Look Like?\n\nWhat is a medieval manuscript like? Of course, as every manuscript is\nunique, it is very hard to answer this question in a simple way. However,\nthere are certain fundamentals that we can state. The medieval manu-\nscript is not a printed text; it is written with ink on paper or parchment,\nand it is written by hand. The tool was a quill that had to be prepared by\nthe writer. Exrors in the text had to be erased with a knife. Initial letters\nand illuminations were done by an illuminator. Together, this means that\nthe manuscript was an entire work of craftsmanship, making each book a\nunique artefact to a much higher degree than during the centuries to\ncome, the era of printing. It is also important to understand that the\nmaterial used was expensive and that the literate producers of manu-\nscripts were an educated elite, mostly clerics, from a wealthier stratum of\nsociety. Medieval writing was not the business of the common man, it\nwas a professional business. It was not mass media; it was the fabrication\nof unique objects.\n\nThe functions of a manuscript could be of various kinds. Sometimes\nthe manuscript was just meant to be a status symbol. Then it would be\nplaced in a church, a monastery, or a palace so that every visitor could see\nit and be impressed by its beauty, its bright colours, its knowledge, and its\nowner’s power. Sometimes the manuscript had an ideological function,\ncontaining the law or the belief of the society. When the manuscript was\nread aloud in front of an illiterate audience the manuscript became the\ninstrument for judging malefactors and sinners. Of course, sometimes\nthe functions of a manuscript could be entertaining, moralizing, or edu-\ncating, etc. The different uses of manuscripts probably influenced the\ncraftsmen’s work, and the produced object can from this view be seen as a\n\n106 Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 19, No. 1, 2004\n\n1 Thave borrowed the term\n‘analogue links’ from Anna\nGunder. She distinguishes\nbetween digital links that run\nbetween content spaces, and\nanalogue links. She describes\nthe latter as typographic links\nthat in print run, for example,\nfrom footnote numbers to\ntheir anchor in the footnote\ntext. Another example given\nby Gunder is the text “To be\ncontinued’ in the closing\nepisodes of television series\n(Gunder, 2001, p. 121; see also\np. 1374).\n\n2 This has been pointed out in\n\nan earlier issue of Literary and\nLinguistic Computing (14(2),\n1999), which concentrates on\nthe uses of digital media when\ndiscussing medieval texts in\nuniversity education.\n\n \n\f"

I expect that\nthese kinds of editions will give life to the people of the Middle Ages,\nbecause the manuscripts were made and used. by them. I look forward\nwith expectancy to editions of individual manuscripts where the editor’s\npurpose is to interpret the literacy context, not the literary one (see\nCarlquist, 2002).\n\nOf course, editions of this kind can be printed in books. The editor’s\nprimary task is to give a fair picture of the manuscript, from the view-\npoints of both content and manuscript design. Marginal notes and other\nanalogue links will not be placed in footnotes, but in the immediate con-\ntext of the edited text. Also, there will be a need for a commentary—not\njust a textual critical one, but one in which the editor also discusses the\nfunction and the assumed uses of the manuscript. Finally, the editor must\ntry to explain divergences from other known textual witnesses from a\nsocial and cultural point of view.\n\nMy idea of how an edition should be constructed is inspired from the\nmovement of new philology. The manifesto of new philology was pre-\nsented in a theme number of Speculum (1990). Briefly, it brings the\nphysical manuscripts and manuscript culture to the centre of attention.\nAs Anna Mete Hansen stated: ‘A corrected and constructed reproduction\nof a manuscript text supplied with text material from other manuscripts\ndoes not represent the medieval manuscript: it is a post-medieval recon-\nstruction, and such a text can not tell anything at all about the social and\nhistorical context of the manuscript’ (Hansen, 2000, p. 124) New phil-\nology asks for single manuscript editions where textual variants are\ntreated according to their historical value (see Nichols, 1997; Cerquiglini,\n1999).\n\nPrinted editions of medieval manuscripts from this point of view are,\nof course, a possible alternative, and there are some examples (see, e.g.\nKroon, 1993).? The problem, however, with printed ‘new philological’\neditions is that they can easily become difficult to work with and even\nto fathom. A new philological edition must contain lots of information\non, for instance, linguistic, literary, historical, social, or cultural matters.\nThis is important, as many medieval manuscripts had a function as the\nowner's private library. In this miniature library the medieval reader\ncollected texts that he or she needed, just as Nicholaus Andree did. The\nmany different genres gathered in a single manuscript demand to be\nexplained in a commentary part of the edition, crammed with facts.\n\nIt has thus been hitherto nearly impossible to make a new philological\nedition, but today we have that possibility. Now we are equipped with a\nmore promising tool to present the medieval social culture of manu-\nscripts, namely the computer. The computer has an encyclopaedic\ncapacity that can be used to store large quantities of information, and it\ncan sort and present information in an easily accessible environment.’\nDifferent kinds of systems, environments, and tools have also been\ndeveloped recently to present manuscripts in digital environments; for\nexample, the ‘PLAO’ systems, the BAMBI system, the editing environ-\nment MVED, and the tools Debora and Inote (Lecolinet et al., 2002,\n\n \n\nLiterary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 19, No. 1,2004 113\n\n \n\f"

Even if no single one of these fulfils the aims of a new philological\nedition, these efforts show the possibilities of what can be done.\n\nIn the encyclopaedic digital environment we can have facsimiles of the\nmanuscripts in colour. This is important for the modern scholar’s under-\nstanding of the visual signs that a manuscript contains. We can present a\ntext critical transcription of the text linked to the facsimiles. The text can\nbe represented by many versions, transcripted versions, standardized\nversions, translated (or modern linguistic) versions, etc. The edition can\nalso contain related versions of the same text from other textual witnesses\n(as in the Canterbury Tales Project; see Robinson, 1996). The analogue\nlinks can be transferred to digital ones and they will then point towards,\nfor instance, quotation sources, pictures, or scholarly articles on topics\ndiscussed or alluded to in the manuscript.\n\nThe editor may also insert new links that are not found in the original\nmanuscript, but are needed for the modern reader’s understanding. The\nmaterial linked to can, for example, supply information about palaeog-\nraphy, historical linguistics, terminology, the critical status of the text,\netc. It is thus very important that these links are clearly separated from\nthe original analogue links. The edition is presented at two different\nlevels, one that will give the medieval view of the manuscript, and another\nthat will help the modern reader.\n\nA both economical and scholarly interdisciplinary venture on digital-\nization of medieval manuscripts ought to give new life to the study of\nphilology. It may take the knowledge of the medieval manuscript culture\nfurther and make it interesting in our modern context. Digitalization also\nmakes the manuscripts more easily accessible to scholars (see Kay Drug-\ngan, 1999), and this is important for two reasons. First, researchers will\nbe allowed to study this fragile material not just in the library or in the\narchive, but at home or in other parts of the world. Second, each manu-\nscript is unique and must be seen as an irreplaceable historical artefact.\nThe manuscripts are a part of our cultural treasure and of our history.\nThus, it is vital that this treasure is preserved for the coming generations.\nAlso, the manuscripts must be made accessible to scholars from different\nacademic fields.* Digitalization is an acceptable solution to all who are\n\n   \n\n5 This point of view is heavily\n\ninvolved in the preservation and filing of manuscripts.

The projects have the ambition to build up a national\nphilological network that can revitalize and consolidate this scholarly\nfield in Sweden. Digital editions will, it is hoped, attract new scholars to\nthe Swedish Middle Ages.\n\n5 Digital Editions and New Philology\n\nI will conclude this paper by giving a more concrete sketch of how a\ndigital edition from a new philological view may turn out. Of course this\nis a visionary sketch, and I am not primarily discussing technology even if\nIam convinced that SGML or XML should be used for sorting and link-\ning information (see, e.g. Kiernan et al., 2002, p. 21; Lecolinet et al., 2002,\np. 53). My view of electronic editions is difficult to compare with currently\nexisting digital editions of medieval material. Whereas I am interested in\nthe single manuscript, existing projects such as, for example, the Canter-\nbury Tales Project, The Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, or The Elec-\ntronic Caedmon’s Hymn are interested in the literary text. Of course, a\nnew philological edition can borrow ideas and solutions from other\nprojects, but it is important to remember that the perspective of a new\nphilological edition is different. In these kinds of editions, the uses of the\nconcrete manuscript must be brought to the fore.\n\nIfa manuscript is made accessible in digital form it is important that\nthe edition is based on facsimiles, i.e. high-resolution colour images of\nthe manuscript. The reader must also have the possibility to zoom in on\nthe images. This is important for the interpretation of complicated read-\nings, for analyses of scribal hands, ductus,* etc. The quality of the manu-\nscript image must, of course, remain high even when the reader chooses\nto enlarge details.\n\nThe facsimile’s text must also be linked to a transcripted version of the\ntext that will be printer friendly. The latter entails aspects of copyright,\nbut if a scholar is to use the edition for research he or she must have the\npossibility to work with the text in the old pen and paper context. The\nedition must be made usable.\n\nThe transcripted text must attain the usual levels of critical accuracy,\nmeaning that the edition needs to follow diplomatic standards and be the\nproduct of expert work. The modern reader must have confidence in the\nedited text.\n\nAll analogue links and all paratext must also be linked. For example,\nquotations from the Holy Scripture will be linked to the full text of the\nparagraph, and quotations from auctores must point to their medieval\nsources. The homiletic use of a Bible passage must be linked to the Latin\nVulgate. And if a saint’s name is underlined with red ink it will be linked\nto short articles about the medieval importance of this saint. Because the\nspecific manuscript is in focus and not the single text, it becomes import-\nant that the information on, for example, a saint also discusses local cults,\netc. The linking from the facsimile will focus preferably on the hyper-\ntextual status of the original manuscript.

The thinking behind the manu-\nscript content must be made obvious.\n\nThus, the facsimile will have only a main link, always accessible, to the\ntranscripted text, and the original links that we can find in the manu-\nscript. Nothing else! When reading the facsimile the mind must be able to\nfocus on the medieval product of literacy.\n\nThe transcripted text will also contain links. These are to be regarded\nas a part of the scholarly interpretation of the text. By using hypermedia\nwe can provide grammatical, lexical, or phonological explanations of\ncertain passages without disturbing the reading experience of a text.\nHypermedia also allows us to link not just to articles about, for instance,\nliturgical terminology or historical facts, but also to audio files containing\nmedieval music. By the use of links we can present the critical apparatus,\nallow stemmatological connections to other manuscripts, or point to\ndiscussions about criticism of the textual sources, for all of which the\nCanterbury Tales Project has developed very useful solutions that must\nbe taken into account (see Robinson and Solopova, 1999).\n\nThe digital facsimile edition should reflect the medieval reading of the\nmanuscript, the private library of the original owner, the ideology that is\nfound between the lines, the hypertext of the manuscript, and the digital\ntranscription that reflects the scholarly interpretation and explanation of\nthe manuscript. If this is performed correctly, carefully, and with accur-\nacy, one individual digital edition of a manuscript can be a massive\ngateway to medieval studies.\n\nProducing such an edition cannot possibly be the work of a single\nperson. We are in need of research teams, of production teams that work\ntogether in an interdisciplinary manner. Experts on the Middle Ages\nmust collaborate with experts on philology and digital technology. With-\nout these contacts, there will be no edition.\n\nMaybe an edition of this kind is not just a vision. I fear it may also be a\nutopian idea. But I still think that it can be produced. The question is if\nwe want it or not, and if we need it. I, myself, am certain that we do.\n\n   \n\nReferences\n\nCarlquist, J. (1996). De fornsvenska helgonlegenderna.

Finally the\nauthors conclude on the strengths and weaknesses of the\nanalytic transparency, a policy recently proposed by\nthe political science community in the United States to evi-\ndence claims made with data in academic publications.\nBishop and Kuula-Lummi’s contribution, titled “Revisiting\nQualitative Data Reuse: A Decade On,” provides a journey\nthrough two decades of re-using digital qualitative data created\nfrom previous research projects (Bishop & Kuula-Lummi,\n2016). Re-use provides a unique opportunity to study the raw\nmaterials of past research projects to gain insights for both\nmethodological and substantive purposes. In the past decade,\nuse of the approach has grown rapidly to become widely\naccepted and practiced. This growth is explained by several fac-\ntors such as the open data movement, research funders’ policies\nsupporting research transparency and data sharing, and research-\ners seeing benefits from sharing all manner of resources. A fur-\nther factor enabling data re-use has been improved services and\ninfrastructure, such as the U.K. Data Service and the Finnish\n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSocial Science Data Archive, which provide access to hundreds\nof data collections for social scientists.\n\nNevertheless, challenges remain when re-using qualitative\ndata and Bishop and Kuula-Lummi’s paper engages with the\nroles of context, ethical issues, and sampling from digital data\narchives. Recent case studies of data re-use for studies of\nhealth, food, family, and more are presented that illustrate inno-\nvative approaches used. in both research and teaching. Diverse\nforms of collaboration among primary and secondary research-\ners work to fill in gaps of contextual information, and to gener-\nate deep insights into data. The case from Finland suggests that\ntheir most popular qualitative data set is one generated for a\nwriting competition: a collection of 800 autobiographical nar-\nratives, including some fiction and poetry, on the conditions\nand experiences of poverty. The writings’ popularity for\nresearch lends new insight to the academic debate over recov-\nery of context in secondary analysis, in particular negating the,\nsometimes militant, view held by some social researchers about\nthe absolute necessity of rich context to support re-use of raw\ndata. Responses from users who have confronted the data say\nthat they did so with very little context and documentation\navailable, and further, did not express any need for it. This pro-\nvides evidence that the depth and richness of a large data set\ncan ameliorate lack of context, and that it can stand on its own\nas a resource to interrogate.\n\nThe two papers written by Lawrence and Elliott and\nSutcliffe-Brown are based on social historical reinterpreta-\ntion of existing data from a well-known scholar who pub-\nlished widely in the area of social class, Ray Pahl. They\npresent insight into the re-use of much older data sources,\ndigitized for the purpose of re-use and offer a methodologi-\ncal focus that addresses methods of data sampling and selec-\ntion in qualitative analysis. At a broad level, all three authors\nare confronting a central debate in social theory—the relative\nroles played by agency and structure.\n\nLawrence and Elliott in their contribution, titled “The\nEmotional Economy of Unemployment: A Re-Analysis of\nTestimony From a Sheppey Family, 1978-1983,” re-use six\ninterviews from one couple, Linda and Jim, who had been\ncentral voices in Pahl’s book, Divisions of Labour (Lawrence\n& Elliott, 2016). In their paper, the authors return to these\ninterviews to explore themes that had not been a focus for\nPahl’s research, focusing on emotions and identity. In doing\nso, they uncover new dimensions of agency in the stories\nfrom Linda and Jim. Pahl was explicitly situating his work in\nThatcher’s Britain and criticizing its policies, but Lawrence\nand Elliott take a longer, more historical view on these mate-\nrials. In their revisiting of the data, Lawrence and Elliott\ndevelop a nuanced interpretation, one that acknowledges a\nlonger view by looking not only at how Linda and Jim\nresponded to critical periods of high unemployment but also\ntheir changing relationships with benefits, home ownership,\nand employment. These insights from seeing lives as a tra-\njectory portray a deeper understanding of the emotional\neconomy of unemployment.\n\n \n\f"

She\nre-explores this interview, asking questions of this narrative\nthat were not addressed by any of the original researchers. In\ndoing so, challenges of both missing context and ethically\nsensitive material needed to be addressed.\n\nDrawing on recent work on emotional history, Suteliffe-\nBrown analyzes this text using tools from oral history and\nfrom feminist psychology. As the paper by Bishop and\nKuula-Lummi demonstrates, the presence of limited contex-\ntual information does not preclude finding new insights\nfrom data. Methodologically, this paper also demonstrates\nthe rich potential of drawing from multiple disciplines, such\nas history and psychology.\n\nHaaker and Morgan Brett in their paper on “Developing\nResearch-Led Teaching: Two Cases of Practical Data Re-Use\nin the Classroom” examine the value of using real data to bring\nto life teaching undergraduate sociology (Haaker & Morgan\nBrett, 2016). They introduce two case studies. The first is\ndrawn from sociologist Annette Lawson who undertook\nresearch in the early 1980s to explore the taboo topic of adul-\ntery (Lawson, 1988). This data set, through its topic of interest\nto younger people, presents opportunities for teaching aids and\naccompanying guidance for classroom discussions, particu-\nlarly around relationship values and attitudes, sexual orienta-\ntion, and the role of gender and socioeconomic status. The\nsecond case study is based on Stan Cohen’s 1972 publication\nFolk Devils and Moral Panics, a core text for criminology in\nA-level and university classrooms (Cohen, 1987). With its\nfocus on criminality, youth culture, and its depiction by the\nmass media, it has captured the imagination of students for the\npast 40 years. The authors show how they developed an inno-\nvative teaching resource with substantive learning exercises\nbased on extracts of real data as well as other online resources.\nThe authors conclude by setting out how students can develop\na range of transferrable skills by confronting real data with sub-\nstantive and relevant topics for research methods teaching.\n\n \n\nDeclaration of Conflicting interests\n\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\n\nFunding\n\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research and/or authorship of this article: This editorial and spe-\ncial edition article was prepared with support from the ESRC as part\nof its U.K. data infrastructure funding for the U_K.

Still, the terms are useful for this essay in that they\nhelp delineate the developmental stages of the Internet, which in turn help us envi-\nsion an ever-expanding role for the humanities vis-a-vis technology.\n\nHistorically, Web 1.0 demarcates the first generation of the World Wide Web,\nbasically from 1991 to the dot-com bust of fall 2001. Functionally, Web 1.0 is best\ncharacterized under the general rubric of data: primarily websites and tools that\nallowed for massive amounts of archiving, data collection, data manipulation, and\nsearching, sites and tools mostly created by experts or commercial interests for the\nbenefit of users worldwide. Web 1.0 has been described as an approach from the\nfew to the many.\n\nWeb 2.0 characterizes the second generation of the Internet, after the collapse\nof 2001. O'Reilly was not oblivious to the financial implications of the dot-com bust\nand coined the term Web 2.0 partly to reassure and rally investors, to suggest that\nthe new version of the information age could be profitable. Web 2.0 describes not\nonly the new set of tools but also the new relationships between producers and con-\nsumers of those tools. In its most idealistic manifestation, Web 2.0 is best defined\nby interactivity and user participation (rather than data aggregation). Accord-\ning to O'Reilly, networking is the new Internet’s single most important attribute,\nwhile others point to the significance of customization and collaboration. Web 2.0\nincludes all forms of corporate or social networking (from Google to MySpace);\ncollaborative knowledge building (sites such as Wikipedia); user-generated content\n(including photo-sharing sites like Flickr or video-posting sites like YouTube); and\nblogs, wikis, virtual environments, and other sites that use a many-to-many model\nof participation and customization.\n\nO’Reilly’s terminology is an oversimplification, but it is useful for historiciz-\ning first-generation humanities computing (Humanities 1.0) and for suggesting the\npossibilities and perils of a networked, interactive, collaborative Humanities 2.07\nHumanities computing includes the careful digitizing of textual and, increasingly,\nmultimedia archives engaged in by scholars and librarians the world over for some-\nthing like the last two decades.

The\nDunhuang Project challenges accepted definitions in the humanities, such as what\nconstitutes and is constituted by the West.\n\nMy area of research was transformed by Humanities 1.0. In the 1980s, when\nL was working on Revolution and the Word: The Rise of the Novel in America, 1\nspent hours in archives, poring over microfilms in the dizzying light of a discarded\nmicrofilm reader that I carted up to my office.*1 called it the Green Monster, with-\nout affection, and I] cannot summon up even an ounce of nostalgia for that crea-\nture, which captured so many hours of my early career. I can’t say whether or not\nmy overall arguments would have changed had they been written with the support\nof the new digital archives, but if 1 were to start this research today, what I cited,\nwhat I claimed, and where I made hypotheses or even speculations would be given\nfar greater materiality. Whereas early American fiction was barely a category in card\ncatalogs when I was researching Revolution and the Word, there are now search-\nable databases of early American imprints, eighteenth-century European imprints,\nSouth American and (growing) African archives, and archives in Asia as well. A\ncontemporary scholar could, in far less time than it took me, not only search U.S.\ndatabases but also make comparisons across and among popular political move-\nments worldwide (from democracy to feminism to abolitionism) and possibly make\narguments about the spread of the popular novel and about its ideologies of self-\ngovernance along with the worldwide transportation of commodities and human\nbeings (through travel, migration, indenture, enslavement, and escape).\n\nSuffice it to say that Humanities 1.0-——computational humanities—has changed\n\n \n\nthe way we do research; the kinds of questions we can ask; and the depth, breadth,\nand detail of the answers we can provide to those questions. My colleague Peter H.\nWood, a historian whose seminal 1974 Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South\nCarolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion was reissued in 1996, suggested\nwhimsically that books written before the advent of digital archives and search\nengines should come with a special sticker affixed to the front cover: “Extra Credit”\n\nToward Humanities 2.0: Collaborative Archives, Interpretation, Theory\n\nThe computational tools, the multilingual and transnational archives at the disposal\nof humanists, and the numbers of scholars and students globally who have access\nto any given digital textual database have, 1 believe, been factors in transforming\nthe paradigms of humanistic scholarship and moving us toward.

Choices based\non a complex ideational architecture of canonical, institutional, and personal pref-\nerences are constantly being made.\n\nAs more and more archives are opening themselves not just to unrestricted\naccess by users, not just to questions and challenges posed by users, but to actual\ninput and contribution by users (including the input of multiple interpretations and\ntheories), we are moving to a new generation of digital humanities. Long-standing\nprojects such as NINES (Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Elec-\ntronic Scholarship), led by the romanticist and textual theorist Jerome McGann,\nare augmenting professional, refereed, peer-reviewed archives with features that\nallow individual users to customize the archive (http://www.nines.org). Users can\nreissue NINES objects in their own exhibits, syllabi, essays, and timelines. They can\ntag objects and post their personal classification systems (“folksonomies”) on the\nNINES site where other users can view them.\n\nL suspect that soon this kind of Humanities 2.0 customization and collabo-\n\n \n\nration will be pushed to another level, as Wikipedia-like functions augment pro-\nfessionally archived sources. At sites with such functions, users might contribute\ninformation about the projects in which they are using the archive (from syllabi\nto ethnographic reports), or engage in theoretical debates in an open forum, or\neven contribute digitized content to the archive itself A memoir site, for exam-\nple, might have a hosting function where any user can upload an ancestor’s diary\naccompanied by photographs or portrait paintings. Other users might comment\non, augment, and correct content or offer different interpretations of what the\ncontent means for a new theory of affect and intersubjectivity or for new under-\nstandings of the interactions among governmental policy, migration, race, gen-\nder, and religion.

While most amateur astronomers are good observers\nwho report useful, even incaiculably valuable, celestial findings, some among the\narmy of amateur sky watchers are motivated by a desire to protect Earth from mar-\ntians and other invading space aliens. At some point, professional astronomers had\nto make a judgment call. They realized there were more advantages than disadvan-\ntages to openness and evolved checks for the credibility of observations offered by\namateur astronomers.*\n\nThese profound issues are at the heart of our profession and at the heart of\nthe various debates on the use, importance, and credibility of Wikipedia (the larg-\nest encyclopedia the world has ever known, one created partly by volunteer and\namateur collaborative labor and the standard bearer for both the controversy and\nthe intellectual potential of Web 2.0).’ How does one put value on a source when\nthe refereeing is performed by someone who has not been authorized and cre-\ndentialed to judge?* Who are one’s peers when the validity of the sources is deter-\nmined by community standards enforced by various users, not by professionals\nwho have been certified as the authorities of the community? The distinction\nis important, because for many of us in the humanities it is foundational to our\nbelief system, our reward system, and. the implicit (and rarely spoken) assump-\ntions about who constitutes a peer in peer review, a process on which our pro-\nfession is based.\n\nAs so often happens when we analyze the new, the discussion of peer review for\ncollaborative knowledge-building sites such as Wikipedia throws into relief prac-\ntices so widely accepted that we rarely question them anymore.\" The very concept of\npeer review needs to be defined and interrogated. We use the term as if it were self-\nexplanatory and unitary, and yet who does and does not count as a peer is complex\nand part of a subtle and often self-constituting (and circular) system of accrediting\nand credentialing (.c., “good schools” decide what constitutes a “good school”).

The first,\n“The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age,” deals primarily with collab-\norative thinking and writing; the second, the Law in Slavery and Freedom Project,\nis organized primarily around collaborative research and teaching.\n\nThe first draft of “The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age” is con-\nventional enough. It is a concept paper cowritten by me and my frequent collabo-\nrator on digital humanities projects, the philosopher and race theorist David Theo\nGoldberg. The process of proceeding from that draft to a final one, however, is quite\nunusual. It is a collaborative effort, incorporating contributions made by literally\ndozens of scholars, students, teachers, and concerned individuals who are contrib-\nuting to discussions happening both online and in a series of public forums.\n\nThe concept paper considers the physical and intellectual arrangements of edu-\ncation, especially higher education. It is both a theoretical discussion and an activist\nproposal for educational reform.'! Among other things, we directly challenge the\nnational educational policy euphemistically called No Child Left Behind, a policy\nthat in fact leaves behind over 30 percent of those entering high school. That 30 per-\ncent dropout rate makes the United States seventeenth in educational attainment\nlevels among industrialized nations.

Psychologically (I speak only for myself here), I have to restrain myself when\nthere is a new comment posted for all the world to see on the institute’s site. I have\nto stifle the voice that wants to shout, “Hey! It’s just a first draft,’ or, “We already\nthought of that but just haven’t put it in the paper yet.” Those defensive responses\nare not what collaborative thinking is supposed to be about.\n\nIs this new process worth the trouble? Immeasurably. The project has exposed\nus to bibliographies from many different fields, to the specific uses of terminologies\n(and their histories) within fields. It has been one of the most fluidly interdisciplin-\nary exchanges that I have yet experienced. It has also taught me how one’s words can\nsignal meanings one didit intend. Reader response is humbling; it is also illuminat-\ning. So much of what passes in our profession for response is actually restatement\nof one’s original premises. In an interactive collaborative exchange, one often gains\na better sense of assumptions unfolding, a process that helps make one’s unstated\npremises visible (especially to oneself).\n\nSo what happens to authorship in such a collaborative environment? Gold-\nberg and | address this issue, both a theoretical and an institutional (i.c., profes-\nsional) one, in “The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age.” 1 am not\nsure we know the answer yet (it is one area where we seek the input of others),\nbut we are mindful of what the digital media activist Nicholas Carr has referred\nto as the “sharecropper” downside of Web 2.0: that is, the many volunteer their\ntime and insights, but too often someone else walks off with the profit or the\ncredit. Needless to say, there will be no monetary profits from “The Future of\nLearning Institutions in a Digital Age,” and we are evolving a model of author-\nship that both takes responsibility and gives credit. Because the online tool keeps\na record of interactions, we will be able to footnote contributors who offered\nideas that changed our thinking. We will be able to address contributors with\nwhom we disagree, acknowledging that debate has influenced our final ideas.\nWe will also include, as collaborators, a list of all who participated in the forums\nand the website discussion, whether or not we used their ideas explicitly in our\nproject, whether or not we agree or disagree with their input. In one way or\nanother, all have helped shape our final project, just as teaching does, if only\nthrough forcing us to articulate ideas that seemed self-evident but turned out\nto embed assumptions we had not consciously addressed. We know that what-\never form we devise to acknowledge attribution will be imperfect. But that’s the\npoint of Humanities 2.0. Its a process, not a product.

Discoveries in the computa-\ntional, natural, and biological sciences evoke the deepest issues about what it means\nto be human, but in the academy the humanities no longer occupy the central place\nwhere those issues might be productively explored. Public policy has increasingly\nbecome an alternative to humanistic inquiry rather than a subset or extension of it.\nThis situation must change—not just for the sake of the humanities but for the full\nrealization of the goals of the social and natural sciences as well.\n\nHumanities 2.0 isa humanities of engagement that addresses our collective his-\ntories and concern for history. To be valued by one’s time requires making oneself\nresponsible and responsive to one’s time. For academics, this engagement entails a\nwillingness to reconsider the most cherished assumptions and structures of their\ndiscipline. It is not clear that humanists welcome the disciplinary self-scrutiny, self-\nevaluation, and reshaping that colleagues in the natural sciences (and, to a lesser\nextent, some of the social sciences) have gone through in the past two decades.\nIndeed, a real conversation, rather than a contest, across the humanities and sciences\nabout the benefits and costs of disciplinary change could turn out to be enlight-\nening for all of us and on many levels practical, professional, and intellectual. In a\ntime of paradigm shifts, moral and political treachery, historical amnesia, and psy-\nchic and spiritual turmoil, humanistic issues are central—if only funding agencies,\nmedia interests, and we humanists ourselves will recognize the momentousness of\nthis era for our discipline and take seriously the need for our intellectual centrality.\n\nNOTES\n\n \n\ntion of those abiliti:\n\n \n\n1.

Using\n\n \n\nnew platforms and networked environments, humanists entering the digital arena\nlearned a great deal from the encounter. Expressed succinctly, the tasks of creating\nmetadata, doing markup, and making classification schemes or information archi-\ntectures forced humanists to make explicit many assumptions often left implicit in\nour work. Humanities content met digital methods and created projects in which\nthe terms of production were, necessarily, set by technological restraints.

It may turn out that data mining or large\ncorpus processing and distant reading are substantially different from close reading\nand textual analysis and may bring new insights and techniques into the humani-\nties (Moretti). But my second question frames a very different agenda: Have the\nhumanities had any impact on the digital environment?

Positivistic, strictly quantitative, mechanistic, reduc-\ntive and literal, these visualization and processing techniques preclude humanistic\nmethods from their operations because of the very assumptions on which they are\ndesigned: that objects of knowledge can be understood as self-identical, self-evident,\nahistorical, and autonomous.\n\nWithin a humanistic theoretical frame, all of these are precepts that have been\nsubject to serious critical rethinking. So can we engage in the design of digital envi-\nronments that embody specific theoretical principles drawn from the humanities,\nnot merely work within platforms and protocols created by disciplines whose meth-\nodological premises are often at odds with—even hostile to—humanistic values\nand thought? This question is particularly pressing in light of the absorption of\nthese visualization techniques, since they come entirely from realms outside the\nhumanities—management, social sciences, natural sciences, business, economics,\nmilitary surveillance, entertainment, gaming, and other fields in which the relativ-\nistic and comparative methods of the humanities play, at best, a small and accessory\nrole. While it may seem like an extreme statement, I think the ideology of almost all\ncurrent information visualization is anathema to humanistic thought, antipathetic\nto its aims and values. The persuasive and seductive rhetorical force of visualization\nperforms such a powerful reification of information that graphics such as Google\nMaps are taken to be simply a presentation of “what is,” as if all critical thought had\nbeen precipitously and completely jettisoned. Therefore, this is a critical moment\nto identify core theoretical issues in the humanities and develop digital platforms\nthat arise from these principles.\n\nAt their base—which is to say, in the encoded protocols of operating systems,\nmachine languages, compilers, and programming—computational environments\nare fundamentally resistant to qualitative approaches. We can cast an interpreta-\ntive gaze on these instruments from a humanistic perspective, and we can build\nhumanities content on their base; but we have rarely imagined creating computa-\ntional protocols grounded in humanistic theory and methods. Is this even possible?\nDesirable? I suggest that it is essential if we are to assert the cultural authority of\n\n \n\nthe humanities in a world whose fundamental medium is digital that we demon-\nstrate that the methods and theory of the humanities have a critical purchase on\nthe design of platforms that embody humanistic values. Humanistic methods are\nnecessarily probabilistic rather than deterministic, performative rather than declar-\native, To incorporate these methods, more advanced models of simulation than the\nliteral techniques of current visualization will need to be designed.\n\nThe humanistic tradition is not a unified monolith, and any values I suggest\nhere, or methods, will simply reflect my own disposition and training.

The insights\ngleaned from poststructuralism, postcolonialism, and deconstruction altered our\nunderstanding of notions of meaning, truth, authorship, identity, subjectivity,\npower relations, bodies, minds, nations, intelligence, nature, and almost any other\nontological category of cultural thought. Computation and digital techniques have\nbeen subject to plenty of rich discussion along deconstructive and. postcolonial\nlines. But the distinction on which I am trying to call for a next phase of digital\nhumanities would synthesize method and theory into ways of doing as thinking.\nThis is different from the (albeit important and insightful) directions set by digital\nforensics, code studies, and other analyses of digital materiality and its implications.\n(Kirschenbaum; Wardrip-Fruin)\n\nThe challenge is to shift humanistic study from attention to the effects of technol-\nogy (from readings of social media, games, narrative, personae, digital texts, images,\nenvironments), toa humanistically informed theory of the making of technology (a\nhumanistic computing at the level of design, modeling of information architecture,\ndata types, interface, and protocols). To theorize humanities approaches to digital\nscholarship we need to consider the role of affect, notions of non—self-identicality\nof all expressions, the force of a constructivist approach to knowledge as know-\ning, observer dependent, emergent, and process-driven rather than entity-defined.\n\nLet’s backtrack a moment and review some of the ways humanistic thinking has\nbeen incorporated into digital scholarship, since some useful insights can be carried\nforward from this summary.\n\nAs the first phase of digital humanities reveals, the exigencies of computa-\ntional method reflect its origins in the automation of calculation. Counting, sorting,\nsearching, and finding nonambiguous instances of discrete and identifiable strings\nof information coded in digital form are the capacities on which digital technology\nperformed the tasks of corpus linguistics to create Father Busa’s concordance. The\npower of automation depended on principles that are basically ahumanistic prin-\nciples. The creation of the concordance does not depend on interpretation even if\nthe resulting work supports it, even if it offers a powerful instrument for extending\nthe capacities of humanistic scholars.\n\nThe phase of digital humanities that began in the 1990s was characterized by\nan abundance of critical editing and repository building. Both depended on elabo-\nration of substantial metadata and also engagement with markup languages. The\nscholars involved in this work certainly understood clearly the rhetorical force of\nargument that was embodied in the information structures they created to model\ncontent types and organize data structures. My own direct involvement with digi-\ntal humanities came at the end of the 1990s, as the Perseus Project; Blake, Whit-\nman, and Rossetti archives; the Women Writers Project; and other large-scale com-\nplex editions and repositories were already well developed. Much critical thinking\nwas involved in the construction of these undertakings, and mature discussions\nof content modeling, metadata, and markup all had philosophical dimensions to\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:27 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

But as one of my colleagues was fond of saying, humanists came into those\nconversations as relativists and left as positivists out of pragmatic recognition that\ncertain tenets of critical theory could not be sustained in that environment. Get-\nting the work done—putting texts into digital formats with markup that identified\ncontent—might be an interpretative exercise, but introducing ambiguity at the level\nof markup was untenable, not merely impractical.\n\nDiscussions about the limits of markup languages were a sign of the maturing\nfield. Debates at the end of the 1990s focused keen attention on the ways the hierar-\nchical structure of XML was antithetical to the formal structure of aesthetic works.\nThe realization did not lead to new methods grounded in humanistic theory. Argu-\nments emerged; discussion was heated, insights profound, then scholars shrugged\nand went back to coding. The basic conclusion was that to play in a digital sandbox\none had to follow the rules of computation: disambiguation and making explicit\nwhat was so often implicit in humanities work was the price of entry. The benefits\noutweighed the liabilities. The capacity to aggregate all versions of Blake’s prints, to\nassemble the many witnesses and expressions of Rossetti’s double works in a single\nweb environment in which their relations could be studied, annotated, made evi-\ndent for the first time—these were remarkable leaps beyond the printed approach\nthat had defined the horizon of possibility just a few years earlier. The combination\nof digital tools and networked environments pushed scholarship to a new level.\n\nBut if this is what the encounter of humanities work and digital tools was like,\nthen what could the encounter of humanities “tools” bring to digital contexts?\n\nThe question has more in it than a simple shift of emphasis. The tools in scare\nquotes stands for precepts, theoretical approaches, basic ways of thinking that are\nfundamentally different in the two realms. Humanities approaches would proceed\nfrom a number of very specific principles. The first of these is that interpretation\nis performative, not mechanistic—in other words, no text is self-identical; each\ninstance or reading constructs a text; discourses create their objects; texts (in the\nbroad sense of linguistic, visual, acoustic, filmic works) are not static objects but\nencoded provocations for reading. These are familiar arguments within the digi-\ntal and broader humanities community, and finding ways of showing these prin-\nciples informed our work at SpecLab, particularly in the realization of the Ivanhoe\nplatform. The project of showing interpretation, modeling it, making a composi-\ntion space in which ambiguity and contradiction can coexist, where the non—self-\nidenticality of objects can be made as evident as their codependent relation to the\nsocial fields of production from which they spring (a relation premised on the con-\nstructedness of their identity, rather than the relation of an “object” to a “context”)\nremains undone. Perhaps it is undoable, since the very instantiation of an interpre-\ntative act would reify it in ways that create at least the illusion (or delusion) of fix-\nity. That built-in paradox does not obviate the need to experiment with human-\nistic precepts in the design of digital environments, however; and that takes me to\nthe current situation.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:27 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Virtually no humanistic data lends itself to such parameterization (e.g.,\nwhat year should a publication be dated to in the long history of its production and\nreception’), and it is in fact precisely in the impossibility of creating metrics appro-\nriate to humanistic artifacts that the qualitative character of capta, that which is\ntaken as interpretation rather than data, comes sharply into relief.\n\nBut if the premises on which quantitative information might be abstracted\nrom texts or corpora raise one set of issues, the use of graphical techniques from\nsocial and natural sciences raise others. Graphs and charts reify statistical informa-\ntion. They give it a look of certainty. Only a naive viewer, unskilled and untrained in\nmatters of statistics or critical thought, would accept an information visualization at\n‘ace value. But most humanists share with their social and natural science colleagues\na willingness to accept the use of standard metrics and conventions without ques-\ntion in the production of these graphs (e.g., using the same sized unit for all hours\nof the day seems bizarre for a humanist charting the narrative of Mrs. Dalloway or\niim critic analyzing Memento). Even the supposedly simple act of counting enti-\nties in any study, for instance, raises a host of questions, while creating a chart on\nwhich to graph the information immediately throws the untrained humanist into\na world where the difference between a bar chart and a continuous graph should\ne understood in professional terms. Amateur chart making provides a rash of\nexamples of ways not to do things with numbers, but we are still only in the baby\n\n \n\nool of information visualization, and already the waters are perilous to navigate.\nStatisticians are concerned with probabilities, not certainties. They do not count\nthings; they model conditions and possible outcomes.

The task of calculating norms, medians, means, and\naverages will never be the same as the task of engaging with anomalies and taking\ntheir details as the basis of an argument. Statistics and pataphysics will never meet\non the playing fields of shared understanding. They play different games, not just the\nsame game with different rules. However, the dialogue among probabilistic meth-\nods, modeling, and visualization holds much promise for humanistic work ahead\nas the shift from counting and sorting to predicting and presenting uncertainty\nadvances in the digital humanities.\n\nBut once we depart from the realms of probability into the world of empiri-\ncal or positivist representation, the friendly atmosphere evaporates. The theoreti-\ncal underpinnings of humanistic interpretation are fundamentally at odds with\nthe empirical approaches on which certain conventions of temporal and spatial\nmodeling are based. All maps are constructions, and the history of cartography,\nlike the histories of other graphical forms of knowledge, is filled with productive\ndebates about the ideological and rhetorical force of mapping techniques. Human-\nists are certainly well aware of these complexities, but the tendency to wave them\naside as mere nuance in the rush to adopt Google Maps or a standard. projection,\neven knowing full well that any presentation of an oblate spheroid (the earth) onto\n\n \n\na flat surface (map or screen), is fraught. But more is at stake for a humanist than\nthe technical problems of projection. Both space and time are constructs, not giv-\nens. As constructs they come into being in a codependent relation with their discur-\nsive or experiential production. If I am anxious, spatial and temporal dimensions\nare distinctly different than when I am not. When the world was bounded by the\nMediterranean it was a different world than the one seen from space. These are not\ndifferent versions of the same thing. The entire theoretical weight of constructivist\napproaches to knowledge stands against such a reductive pronouncement.\n\nBut the social, cultural, experiential, psychological, and phenomenological\naspects of spatial and temporal modeling have had very little play in the history of\ngraphical expressions. No space is a given, and no standard metric adequately serves\nthe analysis and presentation of temporal experience. When we expand this discus-\nsion to include the spatial and temporal richness of cultural artifacts, the vision of\na complex worldview begins to beg for digital means of exposure.\n\nStart with a simple example to make the case. What kind of map should be used\nto show the locations in which cuneiform tablets were produced in the ancient near\neast? The configuration of linguistic boundaries and social groupings within the\nMesopotamian region would offer one version of that geography. A simple outline\nof landmasses and landforms would offer another. A map with modern nation-\nstates outlined for easy reference to current events and contemporary place names\nwould offer another. None are commensurate with each other. None present the\nexperience of geography within which the tablets were produced.

The reification performed by a digital\nphotography imaging system trumps in the “this is what is” game. Put the average\nperson in front of one of those screens, and they believe they are seeing the world,\nnot a constructed version of it. Savvy as we are, the concessions made in the name\nof efficacy may turn out to have too heavy a price if we cannot imagine alternative\nspatial models for experienced and situated approaches. Once those aerial maps\ncome into play, they set a baseline against which historical maps are referenced.\nThen the assumption built into the analysis is that the other images are deviations\nfrom that photographic record of Google satellite. My point is not so much that\nwe are naive users, as we may or may not be, but that the force that photographic\nrenderings carry when they are used as the ground on which other images are ref-\nerenced makes it very difficult to dislodge the subtler conviction that these satellite\nimages are the “real” earth.\n\nIf spatial location is problematic and needs historical and cultural relativization\nfrom the outset, then navigation and motion through and across landscapes as a\nconstruction of space introduce another level of challenge. In a striking visualiza-\ntion created for the digital project Mapping the Republic of Letters, letters between\neighteenth-century correspondents move from one geographic location to another\nas if by airmail. The perfect lines of light, looking for all the world like a contem-\nporary graphic of air traffic, make the connection between the point of origin and\nplace of delivery a smooth, seamless, unitary motion.

How would the variable spatial relations of communications be modeled to\nshow these complexities? If that were possible, then the humanistic principles of\ncultural and historical constructions of space would be the foundation from which\nthe visualization would arise. As it is, humanities scholars attach their analysis to the\narmature of preexisting graphical conventions. The primary strategy for undoing\nthe force of reification is to introduce parallax and difference, thus taking apart any\npossible claim to the self-evident or self-identical presentation of knowledge and\nreplacing this with a recognition of the made-ness and constructedness that inhere\nin any representation of knowledge.\n\nHumanistic conventions for the graphical production of spatial knowledge\nand interpretation would spring from the premises of situatedness and. enuncia-\ntion. By situatedness, I] am gesturing toward the principle that humanistic expres-\nsion is always observer dependent. A text is produced by a reading; it exists within\nthe hermeneutic circle of production.

We take such distinctions to be observer independent even if\nthe system according to which we represent, name, analyze, arrive at, and value\nthese distinctions is subject to the same analytic principles as any other expression\nof human knowledge. By enunciation I am suggesting we bring the idea of spatial\nrelations in digital humanities back into conversation with the principles elabo-\nrated in film studies, architecture, cultural geography, and visual and textual stud-\nies that took seriously the analysis of ways representational systems produce a spo-\nken subject as well as engage a speaking subject within their “regimes,” as we used\nto say. Situatedness and enunciation are intimately bound to each other, though\nthe first resides more squarely in individual experience and its representation, the\nsecond in the cultural systems that speak through us and produce us as social sub-\njects. This is not the place to go back through deconstruction and poststructural-\nist thought and its legacy but, rather, to sketch ways these principles could inform\ndigital humanities work going forward.\n\nIf we embark on a project to study inscriptions in the Roman forum, for\ninstance, should we simply take a virtual simulation, a fly-through model made\nona standard 3-D software platform and place the writing on the variously appro-\npriate surfaces? Or should the ways signage works as an articulation of space, the\n“species of spaces” described by Georges Perec, be merged in a mash-up of Chris-\ntopher Alexander's “pattern language” with Gaston Bachelard’s poetics of space and\nthe Foucauldian analysis of spatialized regimes of disciplinary control structured\ninto and structuring architectural and social relations? A ridiculous proposition\nemerges from that impossible sentence. Or does it? The principles of humanistic\nspatial modeling arise from a system of enunciation, as a system, in which eyelines,\nscale, proportion, surface texture, lighting, color, depth, openings, routes of egress,\ndegrees of security, and other tractable elements might be given a value so that the\nspace is constructed as an effect, rather than a basis, of experience. Without mini-\nmalizing the complexity involved in realizations and aware of the risk of cartoonish\nspecial effects, my point is that by not addressing these possibilities we cede the vir-\ntual ground to a design sensibility based in engineering and games. The risk is that\nthe persuasive force of such representations tips the balance of belief; the Roman\nforum of a virtual world becomes far more satisfying and real than the fragmen-\ntary evidence and analytic complexity on which humanistic scholarship arises. But\nthe partial nature of knowledge is another crucial tenet of humanistic belief, and\nrendering a seamless image of “what is” prevents the imaginative critical faculties\nfrom engaging with the all important question of “what if?” The parallax views that\narise in the interstices of fragmentary evidence are what give humanistic thought\nits purchase on the real, even with full acknowledgment that knowing is always a\nprocess of codependencies.\n\nTo finish the examples and summarize these premises, I return to the unfinished\nproject of modeling temporality.

EARHART\n\nj\ni\n\nn the 1990s, the rallying cry of proponents of the Internet was the democrati-\nzation of knowledge made possible by the developing technological infrastruc-\n\nRUUD\n\na. ture. Lost or excluded texts began to be published on the net, some developed by\n\nscholars, others by fans, and still others by libraries and museums. I remember the\npossibilities that these materials offered for the literary scholar. I could create a web-\nsite for students that linked the recovered e-text of Harriet Wilson’s Our Nig, period\nimages of slaves, and the variety of African American cultural and historical docu-\nments found on the then-fledgling Schomburg Research Center website. The seem-\ningly expansive materials for use on the web were far more complete than materials\nfound in print anthologies or other such course materials. For scholars interested in\nreinserting writers of color into critical discussions, the recovery efforts were a boon.\nWe imagined that the free access to materials on the web would allow those previ-\nously cut off from intellectual capital to gain materials and knowledge that might\nbe leveraged to change the social position of people of color. The new space of the\nInternet would allow those who had been silenced to have a voice. Hypertext theo-\nrist Jay David Bolter promoted the freeing power of the web-based environment as\na space that encouraged “the abandonment of the ideal of high culture (literature,\nmusic, the fine arts) as a unifying force. If there is no single culture, but only a net-\nwork of interest groups, then there is no single favored literature or music” (233).\nAs the 1990s drew to a close, and the number of digitally recovered texts seemed to\ngrow each day, Bolter’s prediction seemed correct.

Lam also most interested\nin projects that make something. Here I would like to echo Stephen Ramsay’s recent\nargument that “Digital Humanities is about building things.” While Ramsay has\ncome under fire for his insistence on the applied nature of digital humanities, the\nhistory of digital humanities reveals the centrality of building to the field. In fact,\nscholars invested. in early work on race in digital humanities insisted on building\neditions and digital texts as an activist intervention in the closed canon. While we\nshould continue to explore tool building, visualization, and data mining as crucial\nareas within digital humanities, the narrow digital canon should remind us why we\ncannot stop digital edition work.\n\nWhile those invested in digital text production should continue to flesh out\nthe digital canon, other areas of digital humanities, such as tool building and visu-\nalization, should also be invested in the investigation of canon on their work. For\nexample, the Metadata Offer New Knowledge (MONK) project has harnessed\nmaterials from Documenting the American South, Early American Fiction, Early\nEnglish Books Online (EEBO), Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO),\nNineteenth-Century Fiction, Shakespeare, and Wright American Fiction 1850~75.\nWhile the purpose of MONK is not text recovery but visual analysis, a broad under-\nstanding of the literature of this period is only as good as the data from which the\nanalysis draws. In the case of MONK, a quick search reveals that texts by Sojourner\nTruth, Sui Sin Far, and Maria Christina Mena—authors of color included in most\nstandard anthologies of American literature—are absent? Add to this MONK’s\nclaim that “for users of public domain materials, MONK provides quite good cov-\nerage of 19th century American fiction,” and we are reminded that a more direct\nanalysis of the position of race in digital humanities work is necessary (Unsworth\nand Muller, 2). We shouldn't be surprised at the lack of certain texts used in the\nMONK project, as the digitized humanities corpora is scant and the project’s pri-\nmary goal was to develop a prototype of data~mining work rather than an inclusive\ndata set. However, the emphasis on “good coverage” should concern digital human-\nists. As a field where collaborative teams are able to produce better results than that\nof the lone scholar, it is important to include project participants that can help speak\nto the importance of cultural criticism. Without careful and systematic analysis of\nour digital canons, we not only reproduce antiquated understandings of the canon\nbut also reify them through our technological imprimatur.\n\nUnlike related fields, digital humanities has historically deemphasized theoreti-\ncal examination of the digital utilizing cultural studies frameworks.

In digital humanities, however, we have much theoreti-\ncal work to do in the selection of materials and application of digital tools to them.\n\nTo understand the current position of race and digital humanities work, we\nmust turn to the emergence of the World Wide Web. As the web began to gain pop-\nularity in the 1990s, it was portrayed as an idealized, democratic, and free space.\nTime magazine’s 1994 story “Battle for the Soul of the Internet” is indicative of the\nunderstanding of the newly popular space, uncolonized and free. The original users\nof the web, scientists, computer geeks, and hackers, according to the story, were bat-\ntling against the corporate market intent on invading their open space. Advocates\nof the free web were interested in three ideas: “1) Access to computers should be\nunlimited. and total; 2) All information should be free; 3) Mistrust authority and\npromote decentralization,’ all designed. to allow “bubbles” of information to rise\nfrom the bottom, sowing “seeds of revolutionary change” (“Battle for the Soul of\nthe Internet”). Scholars, too, began to see the net as a space that altered. power struc-\ntures. As Paul Delany notes,\n\nThe Internet has thus mutated into an unforeseen and unplanned information\nspace. Its virtues can all be attributed to its collegial political economy: in a word,\nits openness. Internet’s most important features are its relatively small hardware\ninvestment, a weak (but not ineffective) central administration, little censorship,\nand an absence of specifiable “bottom-line” objectives. Its explosive growth in the\n\nlast few years confirms the dynamism of a collegial cyberspace culture in which\n\n \n\nmillions of users exchange information, collaborate on creative projects, and\n\nhave their say on any subject they care about. (Childers and Delaney)\n\nThe revolutionary power of the net was based on the belief that the open digital\nenvironment was unpoliced and unregulated, open to all who wanted to partici-\npate. The low cost, the “small hardwave investment” that Delany points to, was also\ncrucial, as it allowed scholars to produce their materials more cheaply, increasing\nthe types and numbers of texts available. In his 1996 essay “Principles for Electron-\nics Archives, Scholarly Editions, and Tutorials,” Peter Shillingsburg concurs it “even-\ntually will cost less to produce and therefore, one assumes, to purchase a compact\ndisk than it costs to produce and purchase Hans Gabler’s edition of Ulysses” (25).\nWhile, in hindsight, we have rejected this view as too simplistic, it was a common\nrefrain in the early, heady days of digital recovery, and the decentralization and shift-\ning power structures, as related by these statements, became part of the narrative\nand the mythology that in no small part drove the digital literary studies recovery\nprojects that grew in the 1990s.\n\nFor scholars interested. in reworking the canon, the web seemed an unfettered\nspace that allowed the scholar direct control of what would be digitized and how\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:20 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

Susan Fraiman, director of the Orlando Project, lauded the\nexpansive digital environment, remarking that “what is new in the twenty-first cen-\ntury, however, is that now the guest list of history-making women is electronic—and\nthere are always more seats at the table” (143). The belief in the web as a space in\nwhich the canon might be broken was likewise espoused by the editors of Romantic\nCircles: “One of the strengths of Web publishing is that it facilitates—even favors—\nthe production of editions of texts and resources of so-called non-canonical authors\nand works. This is in part a function of the relative simplicity of HTML (and all of\nthe simpler document-type-descriptions of SGML) and of ‘workstation publish-\ning’ in general when compared to traditional commercial or academic letterpress\nproduction and distribution methods” (Fraistat, Jones, and Stahmer). The ease of\npublication, identified by the editors, was what allowed the broad range of small-\nscale recovery projects to explode around the web in this early period. The insistence\non the web's ability to build new canons, of an applied approach to the digital tied\nto a theoretical model, is a hallmark of past and current digital humanities work.\n\nThe importance of building tools for digital work, common to and controver-\nsial in contemporary digital humanities, has deep roots in this early recovery work.\nThe applied/theoretical model voiced by digital humanists also fits historically into\nthe work of cultural studies scholars prior to the mainstream Internet. For exam-\nple, Jean Fagan Yellin’s work on Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\ntook various trajectories of inquiry, but her 1987 Harvard. University Press edition,\nthe edition that brought the important volume to the center of the African Ameri-\ncan literary tradition, was an applied piece set within her larger scholarly body of\nwork. In recovering the text and conducting the painstaking research required to\ndo so, Yellin has followed a model familiar to those working with digital projects—\napplication driven scholarship. This model of building, grown from the cultural\nstudies recovery tradition, would expand as additional scholars began to explore\nthe digital as a tool by which to recover texts by writers of color.\n\nDuring the 1990s and. early 2000s, in many ways the most productive age of\ndigital recovery to date, projects fell into two distinctive scholarly groups. One group\nwas the small-scale project in which scholars worked individually or as small col-\nlectives. These projects, including The Charles Chesnutt Archive, Voices from the\nGaps, and The Online Archive of Nineteenth-Century U.S. Women’s Writings, were\nmostly unfunded and produced outside of digital humanities centers or libraries.\nThe second type of project was produced by e-text centers, digital humanities cen-\nters, or libraries and museums. Individual scholarly participation was less central\nto such work. These projects include the Emory Women Writers Resource Project;\nthe various projects produced by the Virginia Center for Digital History, including\nthe Valley of the Shadow and Race and Place: An African-American Community\nin the Jim Crow South; and the digital Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century\nBlack Women Writers.\n\n  \n\ncontent downloaded from\n131.130.169:9F fon Thu, 01 Jan 1976 12:34:56 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "Can Information Be Unfettered?\n\nOf these two types of projects, the dominance of small-scale recovery efforts\nnurtured by an individual scholar who wanted to bring lost texts to scholarly and\npublic attention is surprising. Simple HTML projects such as The Charles Ches-\nnutt Archive, by Stephanie Browner; Voices from the Gaps, by Toni McNaron and\nCarol Miller; and The Online Archive of Nineteenth-Century U.S. Women’s Writ-\nings, by Glynis Carr, were developed without the support of a digital humanities\ncenter, technological collaborators, or external funding. Some projects, such as The\nCharles Chesnutt Archive, were positioned as undergraduate teaching and learning\ntools, with undergraduate student partners in the recovery process.\n\nAlan Liu’s Voice of the Shuttle provides a good measure of the huge number of\nearly recovery projects focused on literature and history written by and about people\nof color. A quick perusal of “The Minority Studies” section, however, reveals that a\ntremendous number of the projects have become lost. For example, of the six sites\nlisted in “General Resources in Minority Literature,” half cannot be located, suggest-\ning that they have been removed or lost. The same trend is found with other projects\nlisted on the site. While only 50 percent of the projects in the “General Resources\nin Chicano/Latino Literature” section are still online, other areas, such as Asian\nAmerican literature, have a higher percentage of active projects.’ Digital humanists\nare fond of talking about sustainability as a problem for current and future works,\nbut it is clear that we already have sustained a good deal of loss within the broadly\ndefined digital canon.\n\nCocurrent to the DIY projects were institutional initiatives focused on bringing\nlost texts to view. Much of this work occurred within e-text centers, such as Rutgers\nUniversity’s Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities (CETH); fledgling digi-\ntal humanities centers, such as the University of Virginia’s Institute for Advanced\nTechnology in the Humanities (IATH); and museums and libraries, including the\nNew York Public Library. With limited exceptions, a majority of the early projects\nreinforced canonical bias. Catherine Decker argues that the canon crops up in these\nprojects because of their funding and institutional affiliations: “The reasons for the\ncanonicity of the bulk of the electronic texts available on the web are hardly elusive:\nmost of the large textbases are located at and funded by major universities (or grants\nto university scholars that include a cut for the university at which the project is sit-\nuated).” Martha Nell Smith extends this contention and argues that digital humani-\nties developed as a space to which practitioners hoped to flee from the shifts in the\nprofession that arose out of the cultural studies movement. In “The Human Touch:\nSoftware of the Highest Order, Revisiting Editing as Interpretation,” Smith high-\nlights the digital humanities’ retreat into modes of analytics, objective approaches as\n“safe” alternatives to the messy fluidities found in literary studies. She notes, “It was\nas if these matters of objective and hard science provided an oasis for folks who did\nnot want to clutter sharp, disciplined, methodical philosophy with considerations\nof the gender-, race-, and class-determined facts of life ...

If Smith is correct, then we not only have a selection\nproblem in digital humanities but also have a historical structural problem that\nmight be more difficult to reverse.\n\nOne only needs to review the current work in digital literary studies to see that\nwe have not escaped the traditional canon by turning to new methods of publica-\ntion. The proliferation of carly projects I have cataloged remain but a trace in the\ncurrent digital canon. A search of websites referenced by the Modern Language\nAssociation (MLA) bibliography reveals almost one thousand individual sites, yet\nvery few of these projects are represented in MLA presentations, leaving many new\nto the field to assume that there are a small number of digital projects, often focused\naround a core group of digital humanities practitioners. The perception of limited\nprojects and practitioners is what has driven the recent controversy of the digital\nhumanities star system, highlighted by William Pannapacker’s post- MLA 2011 blog\npost, “Digital Humanities Triumphant?” While I, along with many others, reject\nPannapacker’s representation of key digital humanities scholars as the cool kids\nat the high-school lunch table, the perception of the exclusionary world of digital\nhumanities is reinforced by a perception of limited projects. Impacting the percep-\ntion of digital humanities as exclusive, in both practice and product, is the grant-\ning model. Examination of funded projects reveals that the shift toward innovation\nhas focused on technological innovation, not on innovative restructuring of the\ncanon through recovery. The National Endowment of Humanities (NEH) awarded\n141 Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants from 2007 through 2010. Of those grants,\nonly twenty-nine were focused on diverse communities and sixteen on the preser-\nvation or recovery of diverse community texts. It is striking to examine the authors\nand historical figures individually cited in the list of funding: Shakespeare, Petrach,\nMelville, Jefferson, David Livingstone,’ and Whitman. While there are grants to\nsupport work on indigenous populations, African and African American materials,\nand Asian American materials, in addition to others, the funding of named great\nmen of history deserves scrutiny and even, perhaps, a specific funding program to\nencourage recovery efforts (NEH).\n\nThere may be many reasons for the lack of attention to noncanonical texts.\nMargaret Ezell cautions that we have not revised the way in which we understand\ntexts and because of this elision certain texts, particularly noncanonical texts, are not\nbeing digitized. She argues that “while we increasingly have the ability to digitalize\nany text we please ... editors do not please to select certain types of material and this\nis in part because perhaps we are not yet changing some of the basic assumptions\nabout what an ‘edition does, or in Hunter’s terms, what is “appropriate” (“Editing\nEarly Modern Women’s Manuscripts,” 107). Additional reasons for exclusion are\nstructural, such as the cost of production. Ken Price has discussed “the strong corre-\nlation between the ‘significance’ on which successful grant writing depends and the\ntraditional canon” (281). Susan Belasco, for example, believes “that the traditional\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:20 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

Or, as Martha Nell Smith has argued, the digital humanities commu-\nnity might be adverse to the expansion of the canon and the work that has been\nreinserted into the mix. All of these possible explanations deserve critical attention\nif the digital humanities community wants to promote a broader digital canon.\nWhile a good many of the early small-scale digital projects have been displaced\nor lost from our current digital canon, a few have managed not only to survive but to\nthrive. 19: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Nineteenth Century is one such project.\nBegun as a simple HTML journal, scholars affiliated with the project participated\nin a Nineteenth-Century Scholarship Online (NINES) summer workshop during\nwhich they learned to encode with the international standard of TEI/XML. Once the\nproject was re-marked with TEL it was brought into the NINES federated collection\nof nineteenth-century materials, helping expand its user base and take an important\nstep toward long-term sustainability. It provides a positive example of how we might\ntake the institutional structures that have developed in relation to the digital human-\nities canon and leverage them to support small-scale projects. 19: Interdisciplinary\nStudies in the Nineteenth Century also provides a pivotal clue that might explain\nwhy certain projects are currently excluded from the digital canon and others are\nnot. The archive demonstrates that project value is created. by editorial principles,\ncontent, and technological infrastructure. Projects like 19 have been revitalized by\nalignment with an institution, whether a collective, like NINES, a digital humanities\ncenter, like the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), or a\nlibrary, like the University of Nebraska. The case of 19 suggests that standards and\ninstitution have become a core part of project success and sustainability, crucial to\nthe canonization of digital work. Ken Price alludes to the new canon criteria when\nhe argues that “people ready to embrace high quality work wherever it is found hold\nin highest regard digital work that features a rigorous editorial process and adheres\nto international standards (for example, TE/XML)” (275). If institutional affiliation\nand technological standards are necessary components to the success of a project,\nthen digital humanists must investigate how we might provide both to DIY schol-\nars. Groups like NINES, which provide workshops and outreach, have modeled\npotential ways by which to generate such parameters. Additional efforts must follow.\nIf, indeed, we are beginning to construct a digital canon that weighs content\nand technological choices equally, then it is crucial for digital humanists to theorize\nthe technological with the same rigor as we theorize the content. Alan Liu has more\nbroadly seen the problem as an absence of cultural criticism, noting that “rarely do\nwe extend the issues involved into the register of society, economics, politics, or cul-\nture” into our digital work. If we do not theorize our technological approaches with\na mind toward cultural constructions, we will continue to exclude certain materi-\nals from digitization. One possible model is found in the partnership of Timothy\nPowell and the Ojibwe elders, who have created the Gibagadinamaagoom archive.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:20 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\n| 315\n\f"

EARHART\n\nPowell has written extensively on the crucial impact of technological application to\nindigenous cultural materials and argues that current work needs to be revamped\nso that “digital technology can more accurately and artistically represent the indig-\nenous origins and spiritual story lines of expressive culture on these [the Americas]\ncontinents” (Powell and Aitken, 253). Part of Powell’s response to cultural inclusion\nwas to construct a partnership that shifted ownership of cultural materials from that\nof the scholar to the Ojibwe elders, in effect creating a mechanism by which the tribe\nmight control their own cultural materials.\n\nMy digital project, The Nineteenth-Century Digital Concord Archive, is simi-\nlarly invested in exploring how to appropriately apply technological standards to\nshifting constructions of race represented in textual materials. Our current chal-\nlenge is how we represent varying representations of blackness found in the census\nin a database. How do we represent, technologically, the identification of the same\nperson as West Indian, Mulatto, or black? Amanda Gailey’s recent article, “A Case of\nHeavy Editing: The Example of Race and Children’s Literature in the Gilded Age,”\nreveals the depth of theoretical inquiry that Gailey has invested in applying TEI\nappropriately to complex texts that bear markers of postbellum racial construction,\nparticularly in the decision to utilize TEI to facilitate searching. Gailey notes that “we\nwill use the <orig> and <reg> combination instead of the <sic> and <cor> combi-\nnation (meaning sic and “correction’), as the former pair makes no claim about the\nrightness or wrongness of the readings, only how standardized their spellings are”\n(136). The TEI tag selection is in keeping with current cultural criticism regarding\nrace and language, which rejects the superiority of standard English. The choice of\n<orig> and <reg> reveals that Gailey refuses to value one language usage over the\nother, as would be implied through the choice of the <sic> and <cor> tags. These\nexamples provide a helpful way to imagine the next steps involved in digital humani-\nties work and the treatment of race. While we need to continue to consider how to\ninvigorate a robust digital recovery, we also have a good bit of theoretical work to\ndo in the selection, editing, and technological manipulation of our materials.\n\nOne of the powerful things about the early period of digital literary studies is the\nDIY approach that many scholars embraced, the sheer joy and freedom of bringing\nimportant texts to the larger scholarly community. As we move from simple HTML\nsites to TEI and visualization projects, as we move from individual or small collec-\ntive projects to larger team projects, from nonbudgeted projects to large, externally\nfunded projects, we see fewer scholars working with digital textual recovery. This\nshould concern digital humanists, and we should accordingly begin to strategize\nhow we might reverse this trend. Small steps are under way. We need to examine the\ncanon that we, as digital humanists, are constructing, a canon that skews toward tra-\nditional texts and excludes crucial work by women, people of color, and the GLBTQ\ncommunity. We need to reinvigorate the spirit of previous scholars who believed\nthat textual recovery was crucial to their work, who saw the digital as a way to enact\nchanges in the canon.

COHEN\n\nWhen Roy Rosenzweig and I finished writing a full draft of our book Digital His-\ntory, we sat down at a table and looked at the stack of printouts.\n\n“So, what now?” I said to Roy naively. “Couldn't we just publish what we have on\nthe web with the click of a button? What value does the gap between this stack and\nthe finished product have? Isn’t it 95 percent done? What’s the last five percent for?”\n\nWe stared at the stack some more.\n\nRoy finally broke the silence, explaining the magic of the last stage of scholarly\nproduction between the final draft and the published book: “What happens now\nis the creation of the social contract between the authors and the readers. We agree\nto spend considerable time ridding the manuscript of minor errors, and the press\nspends additional time on other corrections and layout, and readers respond to\nthese signals—a lack of typos, nicely formatted footnotes, a bibliography, special-\nized fonts, and a high-quality physical presentation—by agreeing to give the book\na serious read.”\n\nLhave frequently replayed that conversation in my mind, wondering about the\nconstitution of this social contract in scholarly publishing, which is deeply related\nto questions of academic value and reward.\n\nFor the ease of conversation, let’s call the two sides of the social contract of\nscholarly publishing the supply side and the demand side. The supply side is the\ncreation of scholarly works, including writing, peer review, editing, and the form of\npublication. The dernand side is much more elusive—the mental state of the audi-\nence that leads them to “buy” what the supply side has produced. In order for the\nsocial contract to work, for engaged reading to happen, and for credit to be given\nto the author (or editor of a scholarly collection), both sides need to be aligned\nproperly.\n\nThe social contract of the book is profoundly entrenched and powerful—\nalmost mythological—especially in the humanities. As John Updike put it in his\ndiatribe against the digital’ (and most humanities scholars and tenure commit-\ntees would still agree), “The printed, bound and paid-for book was—still is, for the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:20 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 319\n\f"

Robust academic work has been\nreenvisioned in many ways: as topical portals, interactive maps, deep textual data-\nbases, new kinds of presses, primary source collections, and even software. Most of\nthese projects strive to reproduce the magic of the traditional social contract of the\nbook, even as they experiment with form.\n\nThe demand side, however, has languished. Far fewer efforts have been made to\ninfluence the mental state of the scholarly audience. The unspoken assumption is\nthat the reader is more or less unchangeable in this respect, only able to respond to\nand validate works that have the traditional marks of the social contract: having sur-\nvived a strong filtering process, near-perfect copyediting, the imprimatur of a press.\n\nWe need to work much more on the demand side if we want to move the social\ncontract forward into the digital age. Despite Updike’s ode to the book, there are\nsocial conventions surrounding print that are worth challenging. Much of the repu-\ntational analysis that occurs in the professional humanities relies on cues beyond the\nscholarly content itself. The act of scanning a CV is fraught with these conventions.\n\nCan we change the views of humanities scholars so that they may accept, as\nsome legal scholars already do, the great blog post as being as influential as the\ngreat law review article? Can we get humanities faculty, as many tenured econo-\nmists already do, to publish more in open access journals? Can we accomplish the\nhumanities equivalent of FiveThirtyEight.com, which provides as good, if not bet-\nter, in-depth political analysis than most newspapers, earning the grudging respect\nof journalists and political theorists? Can we get our colleagues to recognize out-\nstanding academic work wherever and however it is published?\n\nI believe that to do so, we may have to think less like humanities scholars and\nmore like social scientists. Behavioral economists know that although the percep-\ntion of value can come from the intrinsic worth of the good itself (e.g, the quality\nof a wine, already rather subjective), it is often influenced by many other factors,\nsuch as price and packaging (the wine bottle, how the wine is presented. for tast-\ning). These elements trigger a reaction based on stereotypes—if it’s expensive and\nlooks well wrapped, it must be valuable. The book and article have an abundance\nof these value triggers from generations of use, but we are just beginning to under-\nstand equivalent value triggers online—thus the critical importance of web design\nand why the logo of a trusted institution or a university press can still matter greatly,\neven if it appears on a website rather than a book.\n\n \n\nSocial psychologists have also thought deeply about the potent grip of these\nidols of our tribe. They are aware of how cultural norms establish and propagate\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:20 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

I pick up this knowledge by osmosis from the people I follow online.\n\nI subscribe to the blogs of everyone working centrally or tangentially to digital\nhumanities.

(And as hap-\npened with blogs five years ago, the critics are now dismissing Twitter as unschol-\narly, missing the filtering function it somehow generates among so many unfiltered\ntweets.) I follow as many digital humanists as I can on Twitter and created a com-\nprehensive list of people in digital humanities.* (You can follow me @dancohen.)\n\nFor a while Pve been trying to figure out a way to show this distilled “Friday at\nfive” view of digital humanities to those new to the field or those who don’t have\ntime to read many blogs or tweets.

            "result": "The Ancestral Text\n\nLet us begin with the question of addressability and access. The research\ndescribed on this blog involves the creation of digitized corpora of texts and the\nmathematical description of elements within that corpus. These descriptions obtain\nat varying degrees of abstractions (nouns describing sensible objects, past verb\nforms with an auxiliary, etc.). Ifwe say that we know something quantitatively about\na given corpus, then we are saying that we know it on the basis of a set of relations\namong elements that we have provisionally decided to treat as countable unities.\nOur work is willfully abstract in the sense that, at crucial moments of the analysis,\nwe foreground relations as such, relations that will then be reunited with experi-\nence. When I say that objects of the following kind—‘Shakespearean texts identified\nas comedies in the First Folio”—-contain more of a certain type of thing (first- and\nsecond-person singular pronouns) than objects of a different kind (Shakespeare's\ntragedies, histories), lam making a claim about a relation between groups and what\nthey contain. These groupings and the types of things that we use to sort them are\nprovisional unities: the circle we draw around a subset of texts in a population could\nbe drawn another way if we had chosen to count other things. And so, we must rec-\nognize several reasons why claims about these relations might always be revised.\n\nEvery decision about what to count offers a caricature of the corpus and the\nmodes of access this corpus allows. A caricature is essentially a narrowing of address:\nit allows us to make contact with an object in some of the ways Graham Harman\nhas described in his work on vicarious causation. One can argue, for example, that\nthe unity “Shakespeare’s Folio comedies” is really a subset of a larger grouping or\nthat the group can itself be subdivided into smaller groups. Similarly, one might\nsay that the individual plays in a given group arem’t really discrete entities and so\ncannot be accurately counted in or out of that group. There are certain words that\nHamlet may or may not contain, for example, because print variants and multiple\nsources have made Hamlet a leaky unity. (Accommodating such leaky unities is one\nof the major challenges of digital text curation.) Finally, I could argue that address-\n\ning these texts on the level of grammar—counting first- and second-person singu\n\n \n\nlar pronouns—is just one of many modes of address. Perhaps we will discover that\nthese pronouns are fundamentally linked to semantic patterns that we haven't yet\ndecided to study but should. All of these alternatives demonstrate the provisional\nnature of any decision to count and categorize things: such decisions are interpre-\ntive, which is why iterative criticism is not going to put humanities professors out\nof business. But such counting decisions are not—and this point is crucial—simply\nanother metaphoric reduction of the world. Principal component analysis (PCA),\ncluster analysis, and the other techniques we use are clearly inhuman in the number\nof comparisons they are able to make. The detour through mathematics is a detour\naway from consciousness, even if that detour produces findings that ultimately con-\nverge with consciousness (Le., groupings produced by human reading).\n\nOnce the counting decisions are made, our claims to know something in a\nstatistical sense about texts boils down to a claim that a particular set of relations\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:20 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

Conflict within, authorial intent versus the social construction\nof the text, and without, the devaluation of editorial work by the larger\ndiscipline, made the field extremely unstable. While textual studies work\n\nwas considered a central aspect of literary studies during the early to mid\ncentury, by the 1990s high literary criticism had driven textual studies to\nthe borders of the field. Post-structuralists rejected the materiality of the\ntext that those invested in editorial work relished, broadening the con-\ncept of text to a definition far more amorphous than that embraced within\nthe textual world. Some, such as Derrida, refused the physical constraints\nattached to text, arguing for “a ‘text’ that is henceforth no longer a finished\ncorpus of writing, some content enclosed in a book or its margins, but a dif-\nferential network, a fabric of traces referring endlessly to something other\nthan itself, to other differential traces” (DERRIDA 1996, 69}. Harold Bloom\nlikewise rejected texts; “there are no texts [| . | but only interpretations”\n(TANSELLE 1989, 4), While American textual studies scholars bemoaned\n\n1, Judith Kennedy (1995) offers a clear and useful summary of the conflict within\ntextual studies.\n\f"

In each of these representations of digital edit-\n\ning the goal remains the same—“to avoid the need to deform the text”\n\n \n\n(cfr. McGANn 1985). Even those who are some of the staunchest support-\ners of digital innovation recognize that early digital editions did little more\nthan replicate print structures. Peter Robinson, for one, acknowledges the\nimitative qualities of early textual studies projects: “The first mis\nis that up to now, almost without exception, no scholarly electronic edi-\n\n  \n\nsing aspect\n\ntion has presented material which could not have been presented in book\nform, nor indeed presented this material in a manner significantly different\nfrom that which could have been managed in print” (2004). It is the digital\nedition’s apparent similarity to print that reassuringly runs through early\ndigital editorial work; the hallmark of the early digital edition is the sense\n\n \n\nof stability and the reassurance of forms that look like a print text.\n\n \n\nAnd while those forms might remain stable, the digital allows for the\ncreation of better-chan-print editions. For example, the Electronic Beowulf\nproject collects dispersed materials to allow scholars to view and manipu-\nlate easily otherwise fragile materials. The focus of the edition interface\nis on the physical format of the primary manuscript source. In truth, the\ndigital Beowulf resembles the book, in the best of the print tradition, that\n\nmedievalist editors dream of — Beowulf collected and collated in its ancient\n\n \n\n \n\nspersed across multiple libraries and countries. Pages\n\nare laid out side by side, and the tools are designed to manipulate the book-\n\nform, rather than d\n\n  \n\nbased image, rather than to deconstruct, separate, or treat blocks of text\nas data sets. Traditionally philological in its approach, Electronic Beowulf\n\nincludes the images of multiple manus\n\n \n\nipts, transcriptions, and other\nimile\n\n \n\n \n\ntypes of support materials, effectively becoming a highly enriched fa\nedition. This method is reinforced by the editor Kevin Kiernan’s stated\ndesire “to draw attention back to the manuscript, not to provide definitive\nsolutions to problems that exist in the manuscript |. . |. The edition and its\nglossary also draw attention to their source in the manuscript by providing\ncitations to folios, folio-lines, and verse-lines” ([2008] 2011).

In\nthe case of the Blake Archive this has meant even how to represent details\nsuch as the variations in the hand-colored poems. When previously faced\nwith the limitations of print, editors either developed a text only edition,\nwhich was inexpensive, or monochromatic reproductions, which left out\nthe details of the original, or published hand-colored collotypes, often pro-\nhibitively expensive (Viscom: 2002, 30).

As long-standing print editorial projects, from the\nFounding Fathers’ documents to Shakespeare, develop digital components,\nversions, or editions, and as presses in the United States now seem less\nlikely to support large-scale editorial projects, it seems apparent that the\nfuture of editing is digital. Early projects along these lines have been so suc-\n\n \n\ncessful that Kenneth Price has maintained that “digital work has achieved\nprimacy only for editions” (2007, 434). But what if we flip Price’s statement’:\n\ntextual studies are central to digital humanities work. Textual studies theo-\n\n   \n\nries, forms, practices, and methodologies have been and are interwoven\ninto the digital humanities. But what, exactly, does the legacy of textual\nstudies mean to the way in which we understand digital literary studies?\nIn spite of the importance of digital editorial production, many prac-\ntitioners of digital humanities lack an understanding of the theories,\nmethodologies, and history of textual studies. Editions are recognized\nearly digital forms, yet issues of production that hinge on methodology\nin scholarly editing, from TEI to interface design, have been integrated\nin the field without a clear understanding of their historical context. At\nthe same time, some in the digital humanities community have begun to\nview digital edition building as technologically unsophisticated, in effect\nechoing lan Small’s view of editing as “a largely pragmatic, unsophisticated\nactivity” (1999, 43). Amanda Gailey and Andrew Jewell call this techno-\nlogical hipsterism: “This shift in focus from content development to tech-\nnological innovation, a trend that sometimes seems driven by innovation\nfor innovation’s sake, can at its worst seem fo posit a ‘hipster ethos’ for\n\n \n\nthe digital humanities community—that the quality of the work you do\nis not so important as staying at the edge of innovation, always one step\nahead of the unfashionable masses” (2012, 5). We might wonder if digital\nhumanities is potentially in danger of replicating the rejection of edition\nbuilding years ago at the hands of literary critics? Michael Groden sums up\nthe initial divide: “Literary theorists and critics have tended to see edit-\ning and bibliography as activities that are preliminary to criticism and the\ntextual theorists and critics themselves as concerned only with empirical\nevidence, often with minute details (commas, watermarks)’ (1991, 259).\nWe must guard against a similar paradigm within the digital humanities by\nwhich editing would be viewed merely as preliminary to the “real work” of\n\f"

There is good reason to consider\ntextual studies a central pillar of digital humanities work.\n\nThe centrality of textual studies to digital humanities has helped to\ndraw charges of a lack of critical rigor in digital humanities work. Leroy F.\nSearle has suggested that “[flor an earlier generation, the vocation of edito-\nrial schola\n\n \n\nhip often seemed a haven (if not the very citadel) of intellec-\n\ntual probity, in which one could practice a science —mild and respectful, if\n\n \n\nsometimes dull—without being drawn into the relatively unregulated life\n\nof literary criticism and theory, where, as L A. Richards remarked after a\n\n \n\nlifetime of experience with it, ‘an indecent disregard of fact is still current\nform” (SzarLe 2004, 3). Martha Nell Smith makes a similar argument\nregarding the conservatism of digital humanities, arguing that the repli-\ncation of traditional methodologies damages the possibilities contained\nwithin the new medium. In “The Human Touch: Software of the Highest\nOrder, Revisiting Editing as Interpretation”, Smith (2007) points to the\nway in which digital humanities has retreated into the modes of analytic,\n\nobjective approaches as a “safe” alternative to the messy fluidities found in\n\n \n\nas if these matters of objective and hard\nharp, dis-\nciplined, methodical philosophy with considerations of the gender, race-,\nand class-determined facts of life [.. ]. Humanities computing seemed to\noffer a space free from all chis messiness and a return to objective questions\nof representation” (2007, 4). The methodological histories of textual studies\nprofoundly inform arguments voiced by Searle and Smith, and would be of\ngreat utility to digital humanists.\n\nPerhaps the area of greatest impact of the historical traditions of tex-\n\nliterary studies, noting: “{ilt w:\n\n \n\nscience provided an oasis for folks who do not want to chatter\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nson what we might call a whole-text approach\nin the potential creation of a digital edition that is not deformed, that\n\ntual studies is the emph\n\nis a trustworthy text that has been subjected to strict editorial controls.\nPeter Shillingsburg has very vocally argued for such an approach to digital\ntexts: “Out of many (methodologies), one, but not a singularity of mono-\nlithic view\n\n \n\nrather a general methodology of relational complexities: that\ncan be the aesthetics of scholarly editing in the twenty-first century if we\nunderstand that the emerging oneness does not consist of simplification or\nelimination of the complexity but instead that it arises from our recogni-\ntion of the textual condition understood whole” (2006, 23-24). The final\noutcome is still a centrality of the whole text, not text as discrete parts bro-\nken into data chunks as we see, for instance, in approaches whose goal is\ndata mining.

As digital humanists experiment with data\nmining and visualizations, the treatment of the text is less about a repre-\nsentation and more about interpretation created through an algorithmic\nmanipulation of the textual data points. Such an approach is counter to\nthose who championed the digital edition, bur there remains no reason\nwhy such approaches cannot coexist within the larger digital humanities.\nOne of the dangers of the loss of textual studies traditions is that we have\nnot critically attended to the means by which certain approaches to digiti-\nzation have brought particularized assumptions into the field (SMALL 1999,\n43). TEPs Hmitations have received a great deal of attention, bur the big\ndata approaches are also flawed due to a lack of critical unders\n\n \n\nanding of\n\n \n\n \n\nthe processes of production and their methodological reasons in scholarly\n\nediting.

The majority of scholarly editorial\nwork has focused on the interface as a display and interaction mechanism,\nas a single representation of the theoretical conception of editorial produc\ntion. But what if we were, instead, to utilize the notion interface as con-\nstructed by chemistry, creating a surface that forms a common boundary\nbetween two different phases? If we understand “interface” in this manner,\nthen we might accept that the boundary necessitates multiple phases or\napproaches working in contact with each other, and that at those points\nof contact there is more interaction and interpretative flexibility. In this\nmodel, the interface allows seemingly contradictory items to coexist and\nwork with one another. Data sets and editions can coexist, but only if chose\nfrom digital and textual editors can find bridges to those approaching digi-\ntal humanities from other traditions and with other goals.\n\nTexas A@M University\n\f"

There it may itself cause the formation of further rills and\n\nripples in otherwise undisturbed water.\n\nThis image became a metaphor for how the emerging entanglement\nof technology and its imperatives with the practices and values of\n\nhumanities research has become not only a point of intersection, but\n\na roiling flow of both predictable and unexpected contingencies. The\n\nmethodological moment in the digital humanities is well theorised and\n\ndocumented. At the level of the individual scholar, choosing to use, for\n\nexample, a set of statistically determined topics generated by a software\n\ntool like Mallet, rather than a similar set extracted by the linear process\n\nof conventional reading, represents a difference in degree rather than\n\nkind.

In 2013, a very diverse set of\nstakeholders came together under the aegis of the ESF-funded Network\nfor Digital Methods in the Arts and Humanities (NeDiMAH) in order to\ndiscuss how we, as policymakers, as librarians, as funding agencies, as\nhumanists, and as computer scientists, might make sense of the changes\ntechnology was, and was not, bringing into our professional lives. The\nissues that this meeting raised also seemed diverse, even disconnected,\nat the time, and the measures that the stakeholders proposed to address\nthem were equally multifarious and fragmented. After all, the tensions\nthat technology introduces into research processes are more easily\nmanaged during certain phases than others: according to the principles\nof academic freedom, the scholar chooses her field of enquiry and can\n(within reason) define the appropriate methods for addressing her\nresearch questions. But the creation of knowledge is only part of the\nscholarly process; the sharing of that knowledge is an equally important\npart, a fact that can force a mismatch between the media and the message\nof scholarly communication.\nThe meeting focussed on these issues, and as a result produced two\nmajor outputs, the first of which was a useful taxonomy of objects that\ncould be viewed as scholarship, including suggestions as to how they\nmight be ideally disseminated and evaluated. This taxonomy divided\nthe landscape of scholarly output that one might find in the digital\nhumanities into six categories, only one of which has a clear precedent\nand place in the traditional flows of production, dissemination, and\nevaluation, namely print paradigm publications within closed formats\n\n \n\n(such as PDF documents). Alongside this we included electronic\nparadigm publications as a broad category that included everything\nfrom enhanced publications to blogs and Twitter corpora, to arguments\npresented in video and audio. Another paired set of entries in the list\n\n \n\nincluded single or collected/curated primary sources alongside datasets\ncomprised of simpler objects, such as query results and intermediary\nprocessing files.

For\nthis reason, for each of the categories the group extended their work to\ninclude, firstly, the manner in which such work would be disseminated or\ncommunicated to an audience (a non-negotiable aspect for any research\noutput, for research that is not ultimately shared with a community\nof practice cannot form the basis for further work); and, secondly, the\nbasis wpon which such work could build its credibility and be validated\nby the community.

As knowledge creation and consumption paradigms change,\nthe authority that used to be reserved only for formal communications\nis shifting.\n\nAt the macro level, the growing acceptance of research approaches\nsuch as ‘citizen science’ has pointed toward this shift; but, even within\ncircles of professional researchers, the nature and sources of scholarly\nauthority have become contested. For example, a major issue identified\nat the 2013 NeDiIMAH network meeting was the need to differentiate\nbetween two divergent processes: communication and publication. The\ndifference between the two is defined here as: making your data and\nresults public (communication); or, submitting them to peer review\nor other sort of verification by the scholarly community (publication),\nwhich may or may not include the publisher editing, enriching, and\nenhancing the work. In particular, this configuration (and the hierarchy\nitimplies) is under pressures brought about by the emergence of ‘impact’\nas a new value in scholarship, and the need to justify research spending\nin publicly-funded systems. The need for both of these processes is\nincreasingly clear, but the relationship between them is increasingly\nmuddy. The issues of evaluation and marketing are implicated here, as\nis the question of publication format and what to make available: form\nand content are both very much in play in the current environment,\nwhich creates particular challenges and opportunities.\n\nThis is not to say that all of the meta-discussion about how to\nassimilate the digital into the traditions of the humanistic epistemic\nculture has been informal, or even low profile.

Far\nmore recently, Smiljana Antonijevic’s large-scale ethnographic study\nof digital humanities (DH) and ‘DHers’ Amongst Digital Humanists* has\ndone the same for the question of how skills and capacities are developed\nwithin emerging and traditional spaces and interactions of DH. And\nyet, despite all of the excellent work being done, it seems that the\nundamental cultural change required to mainstream uniquely digital\nactivities alongside digitised ones that are construed as surrogates for\nanalogue processes, is still very much incomplete.\n\nSince this discussion began, some things have changed, while others\nave not. The recognition that the digital is transforming research,\nincluding, and perhaps at this moment especially, in the humanities,\nis more widespread. That said, the critical traditions and strong\ncommitment to qualitative approaches inherent in the humanities\nleave the digital humanities at risk of being caught between the poles\nof conservatism and technological disruption. This raises the question\nof whether the triangulation with digital methods changes the work of\nhe humanities’ disciplines only in degree, or indeed in kind. In spite\nof this, digital humanities is no longer merely a rare or niche approach\n\n \n\nhat is fashionable yet suspect, but is rapidly becoming an embedded\nmodality in the scholarly landscape. As a result, much of the growth\nin the impact of the digital on scholarship is now happening not so\nmuch ‘at scale’ in the large projects and research centres, but in the\n‘long tail’, among researchers who might vehemently deny being in\nany way digital scholars, but whose work is still marked by the way in\nwhich technology transforms their interactions and interferes with the\nscholarly ecosystem. The manner in which the policy environment is\nembracing and encompassing the digital provides an assurance of this,\nalbeit not necessarily a comforting one.\n\nTake, for example, the development of the European Open Science\nCloud (EOSC), an institution that, at the time of this volume’s release,\nis still very much in flux, but also very much in the minds and mouths\n\n \n\n85-102, https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqm045.

The prospect of the requirement\nthat all finded European researchers deposit their data in an open\nrepository for reuse by others forces us to face a host of questions\nthat would have otherwise lain unresolved. Who owns the source\nmaterial that comprises the fundamental building blocks of research\nin disciplines like literature, history, music, or art history? And if the\nanswer is that we, as researchers, do not own them, how are we to\nshare them? What are the new data streams and sets that humanists\ncreate? Should paradata be more formally captured during the research\nprocess, and if so, how do we untangle it from the uniquely formed\nscholarly instrument of the individual humanist so as to make such data\nepistemically available to others?

A recent Twitter\nthread initiated by Miriam Posner’ illustrates yet again, that many\nhumanists resist the term ‘data’ as a descriptor for their primary and\n\n \n\nsecondary sources, or indeed for almost anything they produce in the\ncourse of their research. The fact that humanists already have a much\nricher and more nuanced vocabulary to describe these research objects\nis surely a part of the reason for this resistance, but the manner in which\nthe term ‘data’ is deployed in disciplines that are primarily data-driven\nmay also be a part of the hesitation concerning its adoption. In computer\nscience, for example, this one word can be used to describe inputs,\nresults, or intermediary research outputs; it can be relatively simple\nor highly complex; and it can be human-readable, or only intended for\nmachines. The differentiation in provenance, value, importance, and\nauthority of these different types of objects is one that humanists are\nhighly sensitive to, making the adoption of the word ‘data’, with all\nof its slippery overdetermination, problematic indeed.

The system is riddled with markers of quality, prestige, and\nauthority that are reliant on established proxies. Some of these, such\nas journal impact factors and citation analysis, not only create artificial\ndemarcation of the places where quality scholarship can appear, but\nalso, by their very nature, constrain the manner in which scholarship\nshould be presented (which, for humanists, may in the first instance,\nmean books, chapters, and articles). Scholars must make a calculated\ndecision when choosing to embark on a digital project.

Similarly, the use\nof sources of material that themselves may not have been validated in\na formal or informal process, such as blogs or even Wikipedia, give rise\nto further concerns about what merits scholarly consideration and what\ndoes not.\n\nThe territory downstream from the digital humanities (and perhaps\nthe territory of digital humanities asa whole) is, ifnothing else, plagued by\nfragmentation: of institutions, of projects, of infrastructure models, and,\nindeed, even of the different understandings of what digital humanities\nand, more importantly, what digital scholarly communication flows in\nthe humanities are or should be.

The\nexistence of multiple copies of a physical object (beginning from the\npoint when the age of print was established) means, in the end, that\nthese collections provide a relatively trustworthy, but perhaps less than\nsystematic, guarantee that things held to be important in their own age\nwill likely be available to future scholars somewhere when they need it.\nWe have no such guarantees for the objects being created now, as neither\nlibraries, universities, presses, research centres, or national agencies\nhave a clear (funded) mandate to ensure these objects remain accessible\nin their current formats and in migrated formats into the future. This\nfear that resources could disappear, wholly or in part, diminishes the\ncoinage of the digital output. Addressing this difficulty will be a part of\nthe process of ensuring their equal status with traditional publications.\nSelf-archiving is a good strategy for this in many cases, with copies\nmaintained at institutional level, nationally, or by pan-European\norganisations, but this will have its limitations if there is a reliance on\n‘not for profits’, lack of semantic encoding, or insufficient sophistication\napplied in archiving.\n\nOf the many issues that intermingle and influence each other in this\ncomplex and fast-changing environment, three in particular — one\n‘upstream’ and two definitively ‘downstream’ — merit a further detailed\nintroduction. Each of these represents a paradigm in which identities,\npositionalities, and power hierarchies are either being exchanged or\nentrenched in the face of great change. These three factors are: the\nimpact of collaboration as a mode of work in humanities scholarship,\nand the places of both publishers and evaluators as ‘gatekeepers’ for the\nacceptance of scholarship.\n\f"

More\nand more scholarly materials are now available online (whether created\nas a digital native object or not), and some research methods (such as\nthose based on data-mining techniques) and collaborative relationships\nare contingent and reliant wpon this availability. Furthermore, even\nwithin a largely digital ecosystem, less established researchers, or\nresearchers from less affluent countries or institutions, may have\nsubstantially less access to material. It is therefore of the greatest benefit,\nrom a researcher's perspective, to have them as widely accessible as\npossible. Open access does not mean free, only free at point of access,\nand key elements of this development would be to create business\nmodels for this mode of publishing that fit the humanities’ publishing\npractices (such as print on demand for monographs, for example).\nWe need, as well, to understand when openness is inappropriate, for\nexample, in cases where copyright or confidentiality may prevent any\npublication if open access is the only option. There are both ethical and\neconomic arguments for the provision of greater access to scholarship,\nuf we also need to be wary of the turning of the current discussion\n0 article processing charges (APCs) as a solution to the imperatives to\nprovide wider access to scholarship: while this might ease the situation\non the user's side, we could easily create a different risk, that is, that\npublication in the best journals will become tied to the author's ability to\npay, rather than to the quality of the scholarship only. The ‘green/gold’\ndebate around open access to research outputs has focussed a lot of\nattention on this part of the pipeline, but it is important to be aware of\nhe potentially perverse incentives this focus might bring. Underlying it\nare, for example, assumptions around access to funding and/or that the\nest research takes place in the context of an externally-funded project.\nWhile the humanities will be required to respond to the wider trends in\nresearch policy, it is important to make sure that the core values of the\nresearch, along with the value of the research itself, is protected, even as\n\n \n\n \n\nhe social contract with its gatekeepers is being actively revised.\nHowever, access is an issue that goes beyond the parameters of the\n\ndebate around the deposit of scholarly research with trusted public or\n\ninstitutional repositories.

Indeed DH projects, probably to a greater extent than is the\ncase in the more traditional humanities fields, are often communicated\nthrough databases, websites, datasets, software tools, online collections,\nand other informal means of making results public.” However, while\nDH is clearly taking on a pioneering role in experimenting with such\nnew communication forms, there is a problem when it comes to their\nrecognition as formal publications. Even where these new digital-born\nforms of research output may communicate knowledge that is just as\nvaluable as that found in traditional print-based publications, they still\ndo not achieve similar authority. They are not generally regarded by\nenure committees and finding bodies as the equivalents of formal\nscholarly articles and books, and scholars do not rely on them as\nheavily or as frequently as on formal publications, or at least do not\nacknowledge it as confidently. In consequence, when all is told, DH\npublication practices — as distinct from communication practices at\narge — diverge less from mainstream practices than expected.\n\nIf the impact of experimentation in DH on publication habits remains\nimited, what are the factors that inhibit the field’s disruptive potential?\nn this chapter, we want to explore the discrepancy between the novel\ncommunication opportunities offered by new types of scholarly output,\nand the strong adherence to traditional, formal publication habits\nhat persist even in an innovative community of practice such as DH.\nWe start by arguing that books and articles occupy their particular\n\n \n\nosition because of four functions of formal publishing that are\n\n \n\ndisciplines. Nevertheless, the observation that DH groups share more ideologies\nand communication routines with each other than with the traditional humanities\nfields legitimises our comprehensive description of them as an inclusive community\nof practices, as does the fact that a diverse, international and interdisciplinary\npopulation of scholars identifies themselves as belonging to the DH community.\nSee also: Matthew G.

These can be explained by a number of\nproperties inherent in digital technology that together can be said to\ncharacterise the medium. Just as the printed book was fundamentally\ncharacterised by materiality and fixity, digital technology in its online\norm can be said to be characterised by immateriality and fluidity, two-\nway linking, machine-readability (i.e. searchability), and multimodality.\nThese salient properties and their affordances have major repercussions\nalso for academic publishing.’* Some of the changes it has brought\n© textual dissemination can be easily observed; for instance, online\ncreation, lossless copying, and digital dissemination of content have\nallowed a decrease in production and distribution costs, while increasing\nhe speed of these processes. The architectural flatness of the Internet\ngave rise to Web 2.0 networks characterised by a new interactivity\nin which, moreover, all data types converge. However, the wider\nrut not necessarily intentional implications of the digital medium’s\nsalient features manifest themselves fully only gradually in the social\nreception of the technology. In the case of scholarly communication and\npublication practices, the rise of open access — which is predicated on\n\n \n\nhe salient feature of lossless copying at virtually zero incremental cost\n—is a current example. Just as occurred in the case of print, technological\ninvention is thus followed by a much slower sociocultural process of\ndiscovery in which the new medium’s properties begin to influence\nactual communication practices.\n\nAs new tools and methods are developed in an increasingly quick\nsuccession of innovations, the digital medium’s properties continue\nto affect research practice.

The importance that clearly\nattaches to them is evidence that quality control remains crucial in\nscholarly communication. Such evidence also comes from the rise of\na new, fundamentally digital type of certification through networked\ninteractions and iterative versioning. In traditional formal publishing,\nauthors and readers are aware that quality control takes place, but they\ndo not have access to the process: it is a ‘black box’. DH is known for its\nearly attempts at opening up this ‘black box’ of quality control, in one-off\nexperiments such as with Shakespeare Quarterly in 2010, or implemented\nin novel procedures for all publications such as with MediaCommons\nPress.” By providing insight into peers’ interactions with texts, open\npeer review thus, potentially, changes the function of certification:\nrather than the assertion that it has been done, the process of how it is\ndone gains importance.

As\nexplained above, the online affordances of converging modalities and\nvirtually unlimited storage capacity have expanded authors’ potential\nuse of dissemination and registration functions. Besides traditional\nextual forms, presentations, data, and visuals can now be deposited,\nor instance, on YouTube or Figshare, and on stand-alone personal or\nproject-based websites. However, this has introduced the problem of\ndigital longevity. If solving this issue on an institutional or national level\nis already proving a major challenge, how can individual scholars be\nrusted to solve it satisfactorily? If scholars-as-readers are unsure if they\ncan depend on stable references to such online materials, they may even\nrefrain from citing them altogether.” This is not surprising considering\nhat it has taken the traditional infrastructures of scholarly publishing\ncenturies to develop their prized stability and predictability. The\nimitations of the archival function for novel forms of communication\nhus pose an immediate and urgent challenge for scholars from\ndisciplines like the digital humanities, who take pride in generating and\nusing them.

Although\nhe does not directly note any disconnect between writers and readers,\nClay Shirky points out the irrelevance of past forms of publication for\nthe future:\n\nWith the old economics destroyed, organizational forms perfected for\nindustrial production have to be replaced with structures optimized\nfor digital data. It makes increasingly less sense even to talk about a\npublishing industry, because the core problem publishing solves — the\nincredible difficulty, complexity, and expense of making something\navailable to the public — has stopped being a problem.”\n\nShirky’s paradigm primarily applies to scholarship to the extent that\nthe optimal unit of communication for scholars is perhaps shifting, and\nthe potential for disaggregating processes formerly seen as interlinked\n(such as editing, peer review, and distribution) has grown. This is\ntrue for books but also for articles, and indeed beyond these, as long-\nstanding, verified forms begin to become peaks in an overall scholarly\nproduction that has a very long tail. One of the differentiating aspects,\nintroduced above, between publication and other forms of scholarly\ncommunication is that of formality versus informality; but formality is\na standard based upon conservative norms and it is inclined to shift\nfrom one generation to the next. ‘The new way of digital scholarship\n[is] actively sharing thinking, images, films, etc. to provide primary\nresources for others’.”’ This idea of ‘actively sharing’ is not necessarily\ncompatible with the certification and production practices of traditional\npublication, so the informal communications channels multiply and\ngrow in profile.\n\n26 Clay Shirky, ‘Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable’, Clay Shirky (13 March\n2009), http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2009/03/newspapers-and-thinking-the-\nunthinkable/\n\n27 Joan Cheverie, Jennifer Boettcher, and John Buschman, ‘Digital Scholarship in\nthe University Tenure and Promotion Process: A Report on the Sixth Scholarly\nCommunication Symposium at Georgetown University Library’, Journal of Scholarly\nPublishing, 40.3 (2009), 219-30 (p. 225), https://doi.org/10.3138/jsp.40.3.219.\n\f"

Some of this hybrid sharing\nis compatible with the sustained argument form, and the delivery\nand validation norms of the monograph; but in other cases it might\nbe better produced as a digital edition, exhibition, or performance;\nas a blog or other form of open or closed, full-length or micro-length\npublication; a collection of curated and/or annotated links or references;\na methodological or teaching resource; a dataset or visualisation; or\nindeed software, tools, and platforms. But, as Robert Brink Shoemaker's\nexperience of creating the eBook for London Lives seems to illustrate,\nform may not be allowed to follow function, or, at least, it may not be\nvalued by some readers (e.g. evaluators) in the same way as others (e.g.\nscholars seeking insight). Stated another way, the challenge that faces\nus is not to do away with long or traditional forms of scholarship, but\nto supplement them by coming to understand how smaller or different\nunits of scholarly production can accrete to create a sustained argument,\nor speak with a different language yet still be verifiable; and how the\ndepth of the book can be replicated in some cases and for some topics\nwithout simply mimicking, or otherwise creating in another guise, the\nknown form of the monograph.\n\nIn part, these new forms challenge our ability to share knowledge:\nmerely making scholarly output available online brings no guarantee\nthat it will find its specialist audience. Perhaps more critical, however,\nis the difficulty the wider research ecosystem has with validating\nsuch scholarship: ‘humanities have little excuse for holding on to\narchaic forms of evaluation that hold back new forms of scholarship\nbecause we lack a roadmap for how to attribute credit for work in\ndigital humanities.”* Certainly the dependence on the publication of\nmonographs as a marker for scholarly maturity is still harmful in the\nway that Greenblatt highlighted more than a decade ago.

It might be regarded as a\nservice that is provided for the visiting public by the institution.

A previous quantitative text-mining-based study\nof all the REF case studies provides excellent evidence for the diversity\nof impacts claimed for research carried out in the UK’s universities.\nHowever, the report itself makes clear that this kind of method has\nlimitations. Using text-mining methods, we can track the kinds of impact\ndiscussed: the words used, and the connections between themes and\nsubject areas. This in itself is fascinating, but it provides only partial\ninformation. For example, case study authors claimed impact, but, the\ndatabase does not indicate whether this claim was accepted by the panels\nas being wholly or partially evidenced, nor do we know how effective\nit was judged to be. Marks are released as a statistical profile across a\nunit, so we cannot link an individual case study to a star rating, unless all\nthe case studies in that unit, from that university, were marked the same\n(which is relatively unusual). Nor do we know why the panel made the\njudgements they made, or how they marked reach and significance.\n\nWe therefore did not use text-mining methods, since this chapter\n\n \n\nis concerned primarily with exploring the types and quality of impact\nproduced by DH, and the arguments that may be made for it.

We also searched for ‘digital scholar’ (zero\nresults), ‘digital history’ (two results), ‘digital classics’ (two results),\nand ‘digital edition’ (eleven results). In a few cases the same project was\nindexed under two or more terms. Thus, the searches resulted in an\ninitial set of forty-seven case studies. We then read each case study and\nidentified the kinds of impact the case studies presented, and whether\nthere was evidence for them. After an initial reading, it became apparent\nthat, in some cases, the digital resource was either a very minor element\nof the whole project, or that the impact for it was either not claimed or\nnot evidenced. This then left us with a set of forty-two studies.\n\nBoth the panel's evaluation and our reading of these case studies\nrelied upon qualitative judgement because, while text-mining and\nstatistical methods can show that the word ‘museum’ is present in a\ncertain number of cases, we cannot tell how profound an effect, if any,\nthe impact claimed on that museum or its visitors might be. Thus, we\npresent findings in qualitative terms because we cannot know what\n\n \n\njudgements the panels themselves made, nor can we be sure that\nanother reader looking at the same case studies would agree with every\njudgement we make.\n\nAll the case studies provided evidence for the use of their resource,\nin some cases on a very impressive scale.

In some instances, use and dissemination were\nconfused with evidence of impact — a widespread issue in humanities\nsubjects.\" Numerous downloads of digital resources do not, of course,\nprove that users benefitted. However, all but four of the digital case\nstudies did offer evidence of wide-ranging, genuine impact.

There was also no\nrequirement to enter case studies that included digital tools or resources.\nThis means that the case studies represent the strongest examples of\nthe genre that could be found in any given university: cases where the\nimpact of digital projects were difficult to prove were therefore not\nentered or evaluated. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the impact of\nsuch successful and high-profile projects was significant.

The case studies were constructed\nand written by the universities themselves, who were responsible for\ncollecting evidence of change or benefit, and for writing the narrative\nof the case study. However, such a procedure is naturally open to bias.\nUniversities wanted to present their work in the best possible light\nand therefore selected evidence accordingly, perhaps disregarding\nindicators that were not as positive.

The\ncase studies provide evidence of impact on cultural heritage, theatrical\nperformance, the media, industry, schools, religious organisations,\ncommunity groups, public policy, and the interested public. This\nis very welcome indeed. While such results are helpful in terms of\nadvocacy for digital humanities, they are, nonetheless, of limited use\nto the creators of such resources themselves, if compared, for example,\nto Tanner’s model. REF panels provided brief, general summaries of\neach unit of assessment, which sometimes contained comments on\nespecially impressive impact cases. However, no detailed feedback\nwas given, thus it is difficult for resource creators to know what was\njudged to be especially effective, or what might be improved. Tanner's\nmodel would probably have provided a more rigorous evaluation of\nthe characteristics of such projects, but the time and funding required to\nundertake such a procedure may mean that, in an environment where\nresources are scarce, such protocols are relatively rarely used.\n\nThis recognition of the broad impact of DH is very heartening. The\n\n \n\nREF may be a positive force in bringing complex questions about the\nsustainability of digital resources to the fore. REF regulations allow\nthe possibility of research having an impact up to twenty years after\npublication; and feedback on the 2014 exercise suggests this may still\nbe too short a period, even in science and medicine. If we want digital\nresources to be able to have an impact for future REFs or other such\nexercises, they will still need to be accessible and finctional beyond\nsuch a period — at the least. This is a significant challenge, given\nthat, at present, the UK’s Arts and Humanities Research Council only\nrequires resource creators to ensure the availability of a resource for\nthree years after the end of its funding period. It means that universities\nwill need to think about how to plan for and fund the life of a digital\nresource for longer periods after the funding has ended. This entails\nnot only making it available, but also keeping it updated, so that users\nfeel confident in using it. By definition, if the functionality degrades,\n\n \n\n \n\nor the interface seems uninviting, and, as a result, use decreases, then\n\n \n\nevidence for longer-term impact will be harder to collect.

Impact is, as we have shown, not easy to capture or measure,\nbut the experience of the REF suggests that we can offer evidence\n\n \n\nfor the benefit and change brought about by DH resources in many\ndifferent sectors.\n\nBibliography\n\n1641 Depositions Project, http://(www.abdn.ac.uk/1641-depositions/\n\nAncient Lives, www.ancientlives.org\n\nBailey-Ross, Claire et al, ‘Engaging the Museum Space: Mobilizing Visitor\nEngagement with Digital Content Creation’, Digital Schelarship in the\nHumanities, 32.4 (2016), 689-708, https://doi.org/10.1093/lle/fqw041\n\nBakhshi, Hasan, and David Throsby, Culture of Innovation.

Those working in digital literary\nstudies are advised to publish traditional works alongside their digital\nprojects, effectively doubling the labour required of their analogous\nanalogue cohort.! The very promise of performed new media — ie.\nresearch artefacts that can grow and live, and that are born in the digital\nspace — seems to re-stoke debates around print/scholarly fixity and\nthe evaluation of ephemeral objects.> Essentially, those working in the\ndigital humanities are told, time and time again, that their work will\nnot count. At the same time, traditional scholars often perceive the\ndigital humanities as a ‘hot topic’ in which it is easy to gain academic\nemployment and tenure, leading to their fear of being crowded out.\nCertainly, as far back as 2011, the director of the National Endowment\nfor the Humanities’ office for the digital humanities, Brett Bobley,\njoked that there was a fear that DH was a ‘secret plan to replace human\nscholars with robots’.\n\nWhence this conflicting sentiment? How can we understand this\ndouble logic in which DH work is at once so powerful as to crowd out\nthe traditional humanists, while at the same time so poorly understood\nas to need supplementation with traditional publication?

This is\nlinked to longer-term trends in the digital availability of scholarship\nand scientific publication but also to the ways in which the abundance\nof the digital space allows for the publication of a wider range of\nartefacts. For while it is possible for scholars to publish diverse types\nof digital artefacts, and for these to be of a high-quality, to understand\nthe challenges of awarding credit in the contemporary age requires an\nunderstanding of the shortage of labour time for evaluation, and the\nnecessity of frames in the evaluation of research work.\n\n \n\nJudging Excellence\nand Academic Hiring and Tenure\nIn order to understand the broader contexts of the academy within\n\nwhich DH evaluation takes place, we must ask a few further questions:\njust how bad are we at judging whether academic work is excellent?\n\n \n\nWhat about within niche sub-fields?

While it may be true, as Kathleen Fitzpatrick suggests, that\n‘we must be willing to engage in the act of judgment ourselves’, we\nmust also acknowledge the difficulties we face in undertaking such\nacts.’* Importantly, though, this culture is also one that confers value\nupon specific media. University presses, for instance, publish books\nand journals. When ‘university presses’ are, then, the way in which\nhiring, promotion, and tenure panels make their decisions, there is an\nimplicit underlying constraint of the valid forms that may be framed\nfor evaluation through such proxy measures. Further, there is the\nmatter of the continued belief in the efficacy of peer review, despite\nevidence to the contrary, which is linked to a reinforcement of existing\nmedia types. For example, if the labour of peer review is itself a type\nof service practice on which academics are assessed, the motivation to\nreview for a high-profile press — whose brand will once again help\nwith career advancement — is stronger than the motivation to review\n\n \n\nfor radical/new publishers. This then reinforces the types of media\n\n \n\nthat those traditional press entities publish, since peer review must be\nattached to particular objects and media types. In other words, there is a\nstrong circularity of incentives for both authorship and peer-reviewing\npractices that severely constrict change in the type of media through\nwhich academics are assessed.\n\nFinally, it is also necessary to pay attention to disciplinarity as\na constraining factor in the evaluative cultures of university hiring.\nDisciplinary segregation, as Samuel Weber has charted it, is a way of\n\n17 See Bethany Nowviskie, ‘Where Credit Is Due: Preconditions for the Evaluation of\nCollaborative Digital Scholarship’, Profession (2011), 169-81 https://doi.org/10.1632/\nprof.2011.2011.1.169; and Bethany Nowviskie, ‘Evaluating Collaborative Digital\nScholarship (Or, Where Credit Is Due)’, Journal of Digital Humanities, 14 (2012),\nhttp://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/evaluating-collaborative-digital-\nscholarship-by-bethany-nowviskie/.

So, while citing an unpopular figure in\ndigital humanities circles, it remains true that “being interdisciplinary is\nso very hard to do’.” Indeed, the tendency of interdisciplinary methods\nto rest upon a dominant home discipline, while legitimating themselves\nas being ‘interdisciplinary’ through reference to an exotic other\ndiscipline, is omnipresent.

In previous eras, the\nscarcity correlation was obtained through material print scarcity. That\nis, before digital dissemination was possible, a limited page budget with\ncomparatively high printing costs per page came together to enforce\na condition of scarcity. The digital environment changes this. In the\nworld of the digital the vast majority of costs are shunted into the costs\nrequired to produce the first copy, which is still far from negligible in the\nacademic publishing space (labour functions and estates costs include:\ntypesetting, copyediting, proofreading, platform maintenance, digital\npreservation, identifier assignment, report generation, accountancy,\nlegal, property, and equipment), while the costs of producing subsequent\ncopies become almost zero. By decreasing unit cost and also by moving\ndifferent forms of labour onto authors, as Matthew G. Kirschenbaum\nhas recently noted, the print scarcity that previously underpinned the\nscarcity correlation for quality begins to collapse.” As journal articles\nand books — the previous media of print scarcity — become digital\nin their production, their scarcity function, which was always an\neconomic function, is degraded. This is a little like the dropping of the\ngold standard as a way to measure the value of currency. Except, in the\n\n \n  \n\n23 Matthew G.

In common\nwith other scientific disciplines, the rise of the need to disseminate\ndiverse forms of quantitative and qualitative data, software/code, and\ninteractive artefacts within DH breaks the conditions of scarcity in a very\nparticular way. For it is not precisely that such artefacts (the ‘project as\nbasic unit’ as Anne Burdick et al. put it) are not scarce.” Whether it is the\nDigital Library of the Caribbean or the Manycxpurrr project of Udmurt\nState University and Izhevsk State Technical University that is under\ndiscussion, these projects are often unique; the ultimate form of scarcity.\nThe same could be said, of course, of conventional academic books and\narticles, which are supposed to be unique in their original contributions\nto knowledge. Yet, books and journal articles are treated as comparable\nunits of currency, while data, code, and interactive exhibits, in their\nuniqueness, are usually treated as though they were incomparable. In\nthis way, there is a belief in the comparability of artefacts and the way\nthey can be reviewed based on the shared, or otherwise, characteristics\nof their media form (digital vs print).\n\nThis supposition of (injcomparability is predicated on the belief of\nthe uniform (or otherwise) nature of peer review that is tied to media\nform. Although the peer review’s gatekeeping process is usually kept\nhidden due to concerns about anonymity and the freedom to speak\ntruth to power, the furore around PLOS ONE’s reduced threshold of\nevaluation for publication illustrates this anxiety. In the PLOS ONE\n\n24 There are some challenges with the divide that ] am here drawing between a\ndigital abundance and a material scarcity. Since labour is itself scarce and tied to\nmaterial economic scarcity, and since there is labour in publishing, there remains\na real non-imagined scarcity even in the digital.

This mode of peer review\nis designed to encourage replication studies and the publication of\nnegative results, aspects that are also of interest to many data-driven\nsub-fields in DH, such as stylometry and sentiment analysis. However,\nas noble as its scientific purposes may be, PLOS ONE’s altered review\nmodel causes substantial problems for hiring and evaluative proxies.\nHow should the name PLOS ONE be viewed alongside Nature or\nScience? In deliberately lowering its scarcity threshold in the name of\ngood science, PLOS ONE asked the academic community to examine its\nown processes for evaluation. In making itself unique as a mega-journal\nwith this threshold, the brand of the journal has been altered. Yes, PLOS\nONE was, at the time, itself scarce as the only entity of its type, but the\nquality threshold was not determined as comparable with other outlets\nand so the scarcity finction was eroded. The unit of currency became\nnon-exchangeable.\n\nA similar problem occurs in one-off DH projects. Uniquely scarce,\nof course; these artefacts contribute to the diverse media ecology of the\ndigital humanities. Yet, their very uniqueness, while being scarce, is non\ncomparable. That is, because they are one-offs, developing standards\nfor comparability is a disproportionate activity in terms of labour time,\nthat does not fulfil the second characteristic I outlined above. In other\nwords, to evaluate the artefact, as itself, rather than through a proxy of\npresumed-uniform review, has no labour-saving function. This is why\nsuch unframed projects begin to cause anxiety among those who have\n\n \n\ncome to rely on the proxies that they believe denote comparable scarcity.\n\nThis is, in part, why we have seen the emergence of documents such\nas the MLA’s ‘Guidelines for Evaluating Work in Digital Humanities and\nDigital Media’ or the AHA’s ‘Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation\nof Digital Scholarship by Historians’.* However, these guiding\n\n26 Modern Language Association of America, ‘Guidelines for Evaluating Work in Digital\nHumanities and Digital Media’, Modern Language Association (2012), https://www.\nmia.org/About-Us/Governance/Committees/Committee-Listings/Professional-\nIssues/Committee-on-Information-Technology/Guidelines-for-Evaluating-Work-\nin-Digital-Humanities-and-Digital-Media; American Historical Association,\n‘Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship by Historians’,\nAmerican Historical Association (2015), https://www.historians.org/teaching-and-\njearning/digital-history-resources/evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-in-history/\nguidelines-for-the-professional-evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-by-historians\n\n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\f"

The challenge that DH creates in this final space\nis one of both evaluation and authority. In the first case, conventional\nhiring panels often struggle to evaluate part of a DH project; that is,\nthe digital part. A lack of statistical knowledge among members of a\nsearch committee can also cause trouble here for certain types of DH\npractice. The authority challenge that is posed here is an unseating from\ntheir thrones of those with insufficient digital knowledge to carry out\nevaluation.

The practices of DH, which\ncan intrude upon any of the conventional humanities disciplines, are\nchallenging to those at the top of the pyramid since they suddenly find\nthat they are not masters of their own kingdom. The work purports to\nbe in a subject area that is recognisable to them but they know neither\nhow to evaluate it nor how to test the research for relative soundness.\nWhen a discipline cannot evaluate work that purports to be within its\nown subject area, it faces a crisis. Hence why DH poses such a threat.\nMax Planck once famously put it that science advances ‘one funeral a\ntime’. Since disciplines are self-reinforcing spaces, though, it is not even\nclear that this is the case; value systems are absorbed and internalised\nby those who travel through the academic ranks.”\n\nOne of the strategies for avoiding this interdisciplinary threat has\nbeen to establish and strengthen specific DH departments. At the time\nof writing the most recent example of this was at King’s College London\nwhere the department of Digital Humanities advertised for eight\npermanent, full-time posts (tenured equivalents) ranging from lecturers\nup to full professors. Likewise, the School of Advanced Study at the\nUniversity of London is seeking a candidate to lead a new national\ncentre for digital practice. By demarcating the space of expertise to a\nspecifically digital domain it is possible to pursue digital practices\nand to hire staff members in ways that do not appear to compromise\ndisciplinary expertise or authority. On the other hand, this also leads\nto a potentially problematic ‘siloization’ of digital expertise and the\nmerely static reproduction of other disciplinary norms on which it\nis often the purpose of DH to intrude. For example: what use are\nauthorship attribution technologies if nobody who defines themselves\nas a traditional literary scholar pays any attention? What is the point\nof spatio-temporal mapping approaches and GIS techniques if they\n\n \n\ncannot be used to inform other disciplinary cultures? From a research\npoint of view, the banishment of DH to its own departmental area is a\nproblematic move.\n\nThat said, DH as a departmental space makes sense from the\neconomic perspective of teaching.

Some humanists have more\nin common with mathematics than with literature, while others are\nmore akin to social sciences. In the disciplinary segregation of DH then,\nat the same time as providing for a broader perspective and harnessing\nthe benefits of a wide set of views that transcend any single discipline,\nproblems of an incoherent intellectual space can emerge. It is unclear,\nthough, at least to me, whether computational approaches are enough to\nbind together such otherwise disparate fields of practice in perpetuity.\nFor the sake of binding together these fields into a space of intellectua\nauthority, we may see a set of changes — positive or negative — aroun\ndisciplinary coherence.\n\nA similar separation of DH is evident in the proliferation of new\npublishing venues for the field.’ That many of these are still journals\n(the Journal of Digital Humanities, Digital Humanities Quarterly, an\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, are just three examples) speaks to\na deep understanding among many digital humanists of the challenges\nof evaluative framing and media outlined above.

Indeed, many scientific disciplines also feel this\npain of separation between the research outputs they produce and the\nwork they conduct. This is why the recent practice of data sharing has\nsimultaneously become both a welcome activity and a contentious one.\nBilling the sharing of data as better for replication and verification is an\neasy argument to make. Without it, journal articles are just descriptions\nof work without the underlying work itself: a print simulation of non-\nprint activities. On the other hand, very few scientists would consider\nsubmitting a dataset to any evaluation exercise as the work itself.”\nThe same goes for software and toolsets in the digital humanities; as\nSusan Schreibman and Ann M. Hanlon found, there is a ‘relationship\nto [the] scholarship’ of software in which many creators feel their work\nto be a scholarly activity, even while claiming more distant publication\nbenefits.\n\nThe final frame to which DH can, and does, resort is to bypass the\nsymbolic economy entirely and move to hard currency: cash. DH is a\nrelatively successful field in the space of research grants. Sheila Brennan\naddresses this: it is possible to ‘let the grant do the talking’; that is, at\nonce to allow the fact that DH attracts money to be itself a criterion\nfor evaluation, but also to use the accountability and documentation\npractices to produce an archive of creditable narrative statements\naround a project.* Given that all systems of evaluations are economies,\nthe cry of ‘show me the money’ can ring loudly. Yet, this is not likely to\nendear DH to traditional humanists, and it is not clear that DH will itself\nbe spared the axe when the time comes.\n\nIn this chapter, I have explored how and why various systems\nfrom peer review and aggregation, to ‘container-level’ evaluation,\n\n32 There have also been concerns raised about so-called. ‘research parasites’ feeding\noff the data of others, although this seems like a logical and sensible practice to me.\nSee Dan L.

When a\nprogrammer writes software, the result is not merely a digital object\nwith a specific computational function. It is a program that can be\nexecuted by a computer, but, as so-called source code, it is also a text\nreadable by humans (primarily, but not exclusively, programmers).\"°\nIn the case of codework in humanities research, this text is also a part\nof an encompassing and larger epistemological framework comprising\nresearch design, theory, activities, interactions, and outputs. In the\ndigital humanities context, the code part of this framework arises from\na combination of the programmer's technical skills, her theoretical\nbackground knowledge (concerning both the humanities topic and\ncomputational modelling), and interpretations of the conversations she\nhas had with collaborators, both academic and technical. It follows that,\nfrom an epistemic point of view, the practice of the programmer is no\ndifferent from the practice of the scholar when it comes to writing.”\nBoth are creating theories about existing epistemic objects (e.g. text\nand material artefacts, or data) by developing new epistemic objects\n(e.g. journal articles and critical editions, or code) to formulate and\nsupport these theories. In this sense, our view connects back to Bernard\nCerquiglini’s position that the scholarly editions of texts are not mere\nre-representations of some existing textual content, but theories about\nthat content.”\n\nThe analogy we draw between code and programmers, on the\none hand, and print publications and scholars, on the other, parallels\nBruno Latour’s comparison of machines and engineers, with texts and\nwriters.

Thus the labelling\nof a particular software technology as a “black box’ has come to mean,\nin some parts of the humanities, precisely the opposite of what was\n\n \n\nintended: rather than signalling that ‘this is a trusted instrument’, it\nsignals ‘this is an instrument which is suspect, and deserving of critical\nattention.’”* Arguably the perverse implications of the label, and the\n\n14 Bruno Latour, Seience in Action: How te Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Seciety\n(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988).\nSee, for instance, Max Kemman, Martijn Kleppe, and Stef Seagliola, Just Google\nIt Digital Research Practices of Humanities Scholars’, in Proceedings of the Digital\nHumanities Congress 2012, ed. by Clare Mills, Michael Pidd, and Esther Ward\n(Sheffield: HRI Online Publications, 2014), http://www_-hrionline.ac.uk/openbook/\nchapter/dhe2012-kemman: ‘Google introduces a black box into the digital research\npractices of scholars, but interestingly enough this does not seem to influence the\ntrust of the majority of scholars in search results’; also, P.

The result is a poignant mutual\nincomprehension: those who create software often understand their\ngoal precisely to be the construction of a (trustworthy) ‘black box’,\nand they draw upon the mechanisms of science to do so — for what\nprogrammer wishes her code to be considered untrustworthy? And\nyet this very attempt to build the trust necessary for the instrument to\nattain ‘black box’ status, especially if the attempt is accompanied by the\nsort of discourse common in the empirical sciences, causes distrust in a\ncommunity where consensus and dissent work differently.\n\nPut another way: the very qualities and practices that, in other\ncontexts, would create trust in software tools, now tend to diminish\ntrust in them in the humanities context. In order to begin to counteract\nthis paradox we can perhaps draw on the idea of code as an argument.\nAs Richard Coyne and David Berry, among others, have shown, the\ninternal structure and narrative of code ought not to be regarded as a\nmathematically infallible epistemological construct, although formal\nand mathematical logic is involved in its composition, just as logic has a\nnatural place within rhetoric.\" If we consider code as a rhetorical rather\nthan a mathematical argument, it parallels humanities knowledge\npreduction in terms of theory and methodology. Code can thus inherit\nthe multi-perspective, problematising nature and diverse styles of\nreasoning that are particular marks of methodology in the humanities.\nFrom this perspective, different code bases represent different theories,\neach of which needs to show its distinctive, true colours in order to be\nadequately recognised and evaluated.\n\nUntil now, however, most fields within the humanities lack a system\nfor approaching, in a critical fashion, any argument that code presents,\nand for evaluating the workings of software.

They are as different as the two sides [...] of a\nwo-faced Janus. “Science in the making” on the right side, “all made\nscience” or “ready-made science” on the other.’”’. ‘Black-boxing’ can\nhus be perceived of as a process of enclosing the tumultuous complexity\nof epistemological and methodological dilemmas, controversies,\ncompromises, and decisions that are visible in the process yet hidden in\nhe output of knowledge production.\n\nOur objective in this chapter is to apply Latour’s first rule of method to\nhe socio-technical context of creating an argument through codework:\nwe will examine scholarship in the making, and follow and reopen the\ndilemmas and controversies of the process of knowledge production\nefore they get enclosed in the ‘black box’.

There are\nalso other catalysts, such as being hired to do DH programming on a\nproject, doing one’s own ‘free floating stuff’ (as will be discussed below)\nand playing with technology, mastering new tools and skills, and so\non. This ‘spark’ of invention sets off a generative process — building,\ntinkering, tearing down and rebuilding — that goes on until the\nprogrammer understands the parameters of the challenge.\n\nIn many cases, a humanities-specific research question will drive the\nsoftware development and coding. A research design is formulated in a\ndialogue between developer and researcher, and it demands a workflow\nthat can be expressed or operationalised by a developer within digital\nmedia. A particular question might be, for instance, which parts\nof a particular text were written by different authors: ‘I searched for\napplicable author identification methods (which were more related to\nstatistics than to coding) [...] those methods were then “poured” into a\ncode form for practical tests.’\n\n \n\nCodework yields its own reflexive research questions as well, which\nmay initiate new research and new code.\n\f"

These ramifications\nmay occur at the level of the analytical design. For example, will a\nrelational database be used or will a document store be applied? This\nchoice corresponds to a primarily metadata-focused or object-focused\napproach.

Our study also illustrated that,\nlike any humanities scholar, an author of software has her own style in\nrespect to the aesthetics of the code and in the way of working to create\nthe code; and this style develops through both individual norms and\nthe norms of coding communities. We also showed that, in parallel to\nbooks and libraries, code and codework serve as memory systems that\nembed theoretical concepts in order to augment research methodology\nand create new theory where code can be regarded as a performative\napplication or explanation of theory. Finally, our ethnography has\nillustrated how codework actio compares to the publication and reception\nof software where DH programming is still not recognised as a locus of\nhumanities expertise and it is hard for humanities programmers to have\ntheir code academically evaluated as digital output.\n\nThese findings illustrate that, while code and codework increasingly\nshape research in all fields of the humanities, they are rarely part of\ndisciplinary discussions, remaining invisible and unknown to most\nscholars. This invisibility has several important consequences. First, we\nbelieve that the integration of digital scholarship into the ‘humanities\nproper’ will be at a standstill as long as methods of digital knowledge\npreduction remain mysterious, misconceived, and/or mistrusted\n‘carriers of alien epistemological viruses’.” Second, software tools\nbecome ‘black boxes’ in the pejorative sense, as decisions about their\n\n \n\nconstitution are made, essentially, without discourse or oversight.\n\n55 Cf.

We are specifically not recommending\nthat ‘everyone should learn to code’.

It must be\ncomprehensive, both in the sense of accounting for the source code\nand the executed result of software, and by including all relevant\nstakeholders. Based on our autoethnographic observations, we provide\nhere a set of recommendations for the various groups of stakeholders,\nfrom individual scholars to academic institutions and professional\norganisations. Our recommendations are in line with Stephen Ramsay\nand Geoffrey Rockwell’s argument that the evaluation guidelines for\nassessing digital work usually fail to tackle the central anxiety related\nto DH programming, which is how to recognise and rate this work as\nhumanistic enquiry and scholarship.” Where we diverge from their\nargument is in the focus on materialist epistemology, taken in the sense\nthat digital artefacts should be able to communicate their underlying\ntheoretical assumptions or claims on their own. Ramsey and Rockwell\ncontend that such theoretical assumptions can be inferred either by using\na digital artefact or through accompanying stand-in documentation.\nIn their view, such documentation should be avoided as it reinforces\nthe linguistic dependence of scholarly communication, diminishing\n\n \n\nthe ability to communicate scholarship through artefacts.

We are\nback to depending on discourse.’\n\nWhile we agree that providing source code is not sufficient for\nunderstanding the underlying theoretical assumptions, we disagree\non viewing the ‘dependence on discourse’ as a feature that relativises\nthe epistemic and communicative capacities of code and codework. In\ncontrast, we argue that the interdependence of code and text shoul\nbe embraced as a means of acknowledging their distinctive ye\ncorresponding methods of knowledge production and communication.\nJust as code enhances text, making it amenable to the methodologica\nand epistemological approaches of digital humanities; so too does tex\nenhance code, making it more visible and intelligible for the humanities\ncommunity.

These include developing an understanding of\ndata and code, fostering critical reflection on digital objects of inquiry,\nand comprehending the influence of algorithmic processes on humanistic\ninvestigations. Similarly, training in digital methods should include\nsystematic deliberation on the methodological decisions that influence\nresearch processes and results, epistemological and ethical challenges\nof digital scholarship, how to choose the digital tools and methods that\nare best suited for specific research questions, and so forth. In our view,\nwe must reach a critical mass of humanities scholars who feel that they\nhave the capacity to understand, if not every line of code, then at least\nthe general thrust of what it is doing and what assumptions it is making.\nWhen it comes to senior scholars, the results of our previous research\nhas shown that humanists favour, and best learn, in practice, when\ninstruction closely follows their area of study, and when it unfolds\norganically through collaboration with colleagues and students.\nThis is where we see rich potential for developing competencies in\ndigital scholarship among senior humanists as well as early-career\nresearchers — not by trying to turn them into programmers, but by\ntutoring them in the use of scripts and computer programs while they\nare engaged in their own practice of scholarship. This means showing\nthe applicability and working of the code in a hands-on way, and\nqualifying them to provide informed, rather than methodologically\nmyopic feedback on its epistemological qualities. High quality\nepistemological feedback is, in turn, needed to drive the development\nof scholarly software code forward. This requires sincere and engaged\ninteraction between scholars who use code, and scholars who produce\ncode: the former must be prepared to treat code and coding as more\nthan questionably relevant; the latter must be prepared to account for\ntheir code in an academically recognisable form, such as peer review.\nAs previously mentioned, codework is necessarily shaped by its\nsocial context, which may positively or negatively influence the attitude\n\n66 Cf.

Our final set of recommendations thus addresses institutions\nand organisations, who are best placed to provide the impetus and\ninfrastructure necessary to effect real change in how codeworkis received\nin the humanities. A necessary step in that direction is recognition and\nreward for peer-reviewed digital outputs, including code, as research\noutputs.” A precondition for this is to start grassroots procedures for\nthe peer review of code,® and to regard code as alternative expressions\nof research or epistemologies with equal research value and validity,\ninstead of subordinating code and codework to humanities proper.”\n\nAnother necessary step is to clarify the nature of the collaboration\nbetween coding and non-coding scholars, especially those working on\nthe same project. Too often, DH programmers are treated as service\nproviders instead of research focused scholars, which results in a number\nof negative consequences. One such consequence is that non-coding\nhumanists appropriate all the effort and results as their own work and\ninvention, even in cases where their only contribution was to provide\na question in the form of ‘can you do X...?, Where they contribute\nsubstantial research effort and results, DH programmers should be seen\nas crucial peer collaborators whose competencies create a necessary\nlink between the different areas of expertise. DH programmers have an\nimportant responsibility here too in expressing a clear appropriation\nof, and accountability for, their scientific programming work.\nInstitutions can support such accountability by making it a requirement\nfor publications that involve substantial computational analysis to\nhave clear and comprehensive methodological descriptions of the\ncomputational approaches.\n\n67 Cf.Nowviskie, Where Creditis Due; Todd Presner,’ How toEvaluateDigitalScholarship’,\nJournal of Digital Humanities, 1.4 (2012), http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-4/\nhow-to-evaluate-digital-scholarship-by-todd-presner/; American Historical\nAssociation, ‘Guidelines for the Professional Evaluation of Digital Scholarship\nby Historians’, American Historical Association (2015), https://www_.historians.org/\nteaching-and-learning/digital -history-resources/evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-\nin-history/guidelines-for-the-professional-evaluation-of-digital-scholarship-by-\nhistorians (see especially p. 1).\n\n68 Cf.

For example, Mary Dee Harris reported that: ‘I got a lot of\nflak from the Department about my work. One of the graduate advisers\nswore that I was trying to destroy literature by using the computer.”\nJohn Burrows and Hugh Craig discussed the difficulties they sometimes\nfaced when trying to publish their scholarship in ‘mainstream’ English\njournals, as opposed to dedicated humanities computing or digital\nhumanities publications.”\n\nSome discussions on Humanist (which is referred to as an electronic\nseminar, see the further discussion of it below) tally with these\nexperiences.

Digital Scholarship in the Humanities 177\n\nConclusion\n\nThe material cited above shows that many fundamental conversations\ntook place in the years before c. 2002 in the humanities computing\ncommunity about what constituted academic and technical excellence\nin digital and digitally-derived scholarship, about the appropriateness\nof peer review as a mechanism for evaluating digital scholarship, and\nabout whether the digital was a suitable medium for publication. On\nthe whole, the evidence I have gathered here suggests the community\nhad mixed experiences of, and attitudes toward, peer review and formal\nevaluation. While a consensus does seem to have been reached about\nthe importance of formal evaluation for the emerging discipline, this\nreview indicates that it took time to build such a consensus (and, of\ncourse, agreement was not necessarily unanimous). Discussion and\ndebate seem to have played a crucial role in building this consensus\nover the longer term.\n\nExternal factors, such as the growing acceptance of digital\npublication, may also have offered the community an important signal\nthat change was on the horizon and they would need to respond\naccordingly. It also seems reasonable to propose that the wider position\nof digital humanities, which by c. 2002 was undergoing a process of\ninstitutionalisation, made the requirement for evaluative guidelines\nall the more urgent.* Indeed, Matthew G. Kirschenbaum has noted a\n‘rapid and remarkable rise’” of the term ‘digital humanities’ around this\ntime. He has written of the ‘surprisingly specific circumstances’ that\narguably led to the rise of the term, and that included the preparations\n\n58 By 2013, Matthew L. Jockers, for example, discussed the rapidly institutionalising\nfield thus: ‘Academic jobs for candidates with expertise in the intersection between\nthe humanities and technology are becoming more and more common, and a\nyounger constituent of digital natives is quickly overtaking the aging elders\nof the tribe.

A\ndigital research infrastructure is no different: it assembles a mediating\nset of technologies for research and resource discovery, collaboration,\nsharing, and dissemination of scientific output.\n\nInfrastructures are not just service providers, however, but also\nstrong cultural and political symbols. From electricity systems in the\n1920s, to coal trains in the 1950s, through to the gateways and bridges\nrepresented on Euro notes in the present decade, infrastructures have\nbeen mobilised repeatedly in broader spheres as symbols and metaphors\nfor the more generalised march of modernisation, integration, and\nco-operation: engines of change, propelling society into a better and\nbrighter future. Yet, precisely because those ‘human-built material\nlinks between nations and across borders in Europe [...] predated,\naccompanied and transcended the “official” processes of political and\neconomic integration’,’ it would be all too tempting — and all too\neasy — to approach the question of digital research infrastructures\nuncritically by getting caught up in the moment and embracing the\nmaster narratives of efficiency and progress without discussing the\nlarger and more complex implications of institutionalising networked\nresearch. A digital infrastructure is not only a tool that needs to be built,\nit is also a tool that needs to be understood.\n\nEvery decade or so, the conceptual framework used by digital\nhumanists to situate the work they do into the landscape of research and\nits infrastructure is redefined. The idea that the digital could provide\nquick and easy access to resources drove an early ‘access’ paradigm.\nThe fact that we could ask new questions about our data drove the rise\nof a ‘methods’ paradigm.

That said, the future working\nconditions researchers will encounter will be determined, at least in\npart, by policy decisions, and the digital is a particularly pronounced\nplace for research policy to be focussed.

The\nwide embrace and support for FAIR by governments, policy-makers,\ngoverning bodies, and funding bodies has not only made FAIR data, or\n‘FAIRification’, a synonym for high-quality scientific data production,\nbut has also fast-tracked the principles so they could make their way\ninto global policies worldwide,’ despite the many open questions\ntheir implementation leaves behind, and the palpable lack of agreed\nimplementation plans and models at the level of different disciplines.\nConsidering how deeply they are embedded in the landscape of\nEuropean scientific innovation and policy, the FAIR principles have\nthe potential to make a substantial impact on the future landscape, as\nwell as to shape the underlying dynamics of knowledge creation for\nthe better. This chance, however, can easily be missed if the specific\nynamics of scientific production in the humanities are not addressed\nin their discipline-level implementation.\n\nWith the goal of making FAIR meaningful, and helping it to\nrealise its promises in an arts and humanities context, this paper\nescribes some of the defining aspects underlying the domain-specific,\nepistemic processes that pose challenges to the FAIRification of\nknowledge creation in arts and humanities. In particular, by applying\nthe FAIR principles to arts and humanities data curation workflows,\nit is demonstrated that, contrary to the principles’ general scope and\n\n \n\neliberately domain-independent nature, the principles have been\nimplicitly designed according to underlying assumptions about how\nknowledge creation operates and communicates.

Obviously, those handling these data could\nnot know in advance that some information — for example, attribution\nor consent from the rights holders — needed to be collected: this\nrequirement was only brought about by the digital age. Tracing back the\nprovenance of such records is a time-consuming and difficult process\nfilled with uncertainties and lack of clarity, especially in the case of\ncollections inherited from other institutions.\n\nFurthermore, even in cases where the entity holding the legal right\nis clearly identifiable, given the great deal of legal uncertainty and\nvariety present at the intersection of differing national legislations, and\nthe changing landscape of intellectual property rights (PR), in many\ncases researchers and curators are having difficulty ‘translating’ the legal\nstatuses and license information of materials into research and publication\nworkflows and terms of use. For instance, the legal statement ‘In copyright,\nnon-commercial use only’ raises the question of where commercial use\nbegins. Visual material under this legal status can certainly be integrated\ninto PhD dissertations, but what about republishing such material on the\nresearcher's website or in scholarly monographs?\n\nThe broad investigations of archival practices conducted within the\nframework of the Knowledge Complexity (KPLEX) project by Mike Priddy\n\n12. To illustrate this complexity, let us cite here two examples from Carlson and\nAnderson’s two aforementioned case studies: ‘[A researcher] has put a picture on\nthe cover of a publication. He could be fined for that [by the community it originated\nfrom], because the artifact [sic] shows a ritual/secret process.’; and ‘during her\nfieldwork in Malaysia, there was a photo collection (of a former local museum) that\nthey wanted to sell to us. There were photos by tourists, army officers, etc. They\nthink that they own every photo, but in our sense the photographer owns it, and we\ncan therefore not show it’ (‘What Are Data?’, 643).\n\n13 This legal uncertainty in the identification of the legal statuses of cultural\nheritage material is clearly represented in the fact that in the Rights Statements\nframework, which has been designed specifically for cultural heritage data where\nthe rights holder and the data provider are not always the same entities, four of\nthe twelve standardised rights statements refer to unclear legal statuses.

As an active response to the impact of the digital age on\nscholarly and archival practice, a range of research data aggregation\nand discovery projects of different scopes and sizes have been created,\nsuch as: Europeana Collections,” IPERION CH,” and CENDARL® They\nall have the mission to build bridges, interlinks, and networks (e.g.,\nco-referencing systems, conceptual models, ontologies, semantic web\nframeworks) across different types of resources and institutions in order\nto enable the browsing of this heterogeneous content within a single\nsearch and discovery space. Although many of these infrastructures are\nfacing sustainability challenges, their role in computationally-enhanced\nscholarly workflows is indispensable. Leveraging the power of big data\nand linked data approaches enables scholars to gain access to cultural\nheritage resources across institutional and national boundaries, and to\nexplore new, macro-level perspectives and connections between distant\nevents, communities, or traditions that could not have been made visible\nvia traditional manual methods.\n\nIn addition to opening up new paradigms and epistemic models of\nknowledge creation, such research infrastructure initiatives also should\nbe credited with having played a catalytic role in the development,\npromotion, and implementation of shared protocols and standards (like\nthe Linked Open Data paradigm in arts and humanities)” to guarantee\ninteroperability between heterogeneous data resources.

Following up on, and investigating the\nchanging archival practices of cultural heritage institutions in the age\nof big data, the aforementioned KPLEX project* uncovered many\nimportant epistemological implications for the computational turn.\n\nOne of these has to do with losing control over the remediated records\nof archival knowledge and its complexity. In the course of traditional\ninteractions, such as in-person visits or one-on-one consultations,\narchivists had the possibility of freely guiding the researcher through\nthe collections and transferring all relevant knowledge to the specific\nresearch question.

Practitioners’ concerns about the non-digitised or offline\nsubstructure of an iceberg of knowledge, with the levels invisible below\nhe water being forgotten and ‘buried at deeper levels of accessibility\nduring this transitional period’ were clearly articulated in the KPLEX\ninterviews.” It is a serious threat that a new generation of scholars\nmight lose this awareness of materials and knowledge structures tha\nhave submerged beyond the digital horizon, resulting in a situation\nwhere one has to know what it is one cannot find.

This would generate\na further enrichment and even greater visibility of this yet very smal\nfraction of cultural heritage. Such asymmetry and distortion can cause\npotentially irreparable damage to our understanding of human culture.\nAs Jennifer Edmond points out in her 2015 study, such distortion effects\nare also arising from the fact that, contrary to the essentially transnationa\nnature of historical research, the digitisation of cultural heritage has\nlargely been funded, and continues to be funded, along national lines,\nand not every country or institution has access to the same resources.”\n\n \n\nThis results in substantial differences in the digital and online footprin\n\n \n\nphilosopher Gilbert Ryle (1900-1976), but it was the anthropologist Clifford Geertz\nwho developed the concept into an ethnomethodological key notion with sufficient\nexplanatory power, in his seminal work The Interpretation of Cultures (Clifford\nGeertz, The Interpretation Of Cultures, rev. ed. (New York: Basic Books, 2000),\npp. 9-10). Geertz described. the practice of thick description as a way of providing\ncultural context and meaning that people place on actions, words, things, etc. Thick\ndescriptions provide enough context so that a person outside the culture can make\nmeaning of the behaviour. Since then, the term and the methodology it represents\nhas gained currency in the social sciences and beyond, and so today, thick description\nis used in a variety of fields of cultural study.\n\n31 Priddy and Horsley, ‘Deliverable D3.1 Report’, p. 79.\n\n32 Edmond, ‘Tradition and Innovation’, pp. 2-9.\n\f"

Shared standards\nopen up datasets for integration with research across different sectors,\nprovide additional layers of context, and enable research methods that\nhave not been previously available to the humanities.\n\nHowever, aligning the application and use of repository standards\nwith the long history of data curation cannot always be achieved without\nmaking compromises. In some cases, enforcing a commitment to shared\nstandards can lead to a similar loss of detail and information, as was\nseen in the context of the aggregation of standardised and machine-\ninteroperable metadata from cultural heritage institutions. In their 2014\nand 2016 studies, Rinke Hoekstra and his co-authors investigated data\nsharing practices in the humanities and their compliance with linked\ndiscovery context.” They identify two cases in which the risk of losing\nprevenance information is especially high.\n\nFirst, when data is deposited in bigger, discipline-specific data\ncuration projects with top-down standards (such as the North-Atlantic\nPopulation Project (NAPP), the Clio Infra repository, or the Mosaic\nproject), Hoekstra et al. point out that the sheer scale of such databases\nand the top-down fashion of their data curation standards are not\nalways suitable for smaller datasets created by individual researchers.\nThis makes it difficult for them to share their research in a sustainable\nway.\n\nSecond, not every researcher has equal access to the computational\nresources, expertise, and skills necessary to create and operate a digital\ndata collection.

On the other hand, we can expect that arts and humanities\nresearch institutions will not have equal access to these support\nservices, or will not be ready for their rapid implementation.\nTherefore, as a more flexible and more inclusive solution, we\nrecommend European research infrastructures complement\nthe efforts of research institutions with widely accessible\ndata management services (such as repository finders)\n\nAt the same time, we can expect that the en masse application of global FAIR data\npolicies will also have an incremental and large-scale effect on the notion of data in\nthe arts and humanities as researchers will be forced to interpret certain outputs of\ntheir research projects as data.\n\nSubject expertise and capacity for one-to-one consultancy would be key contributions\nfor aligning disciplinary culture with data management best practices.

            "result": " \n\nThe Digital Humanities and Its Users\n\nCHARLIE EDWARDS\n\nj\ni\n\nn her poignant and piercing intervention, “Eternal September of the Digital\nHumanities,” Bethany Nowviskie reflects on how “our daily voicing of the prac-\n\nUG:\n\naw. tice of digital humanities (and not just on special days—every day) helps to\nshape and delimit and advance it” She continues, “That voicing operates whole-\nheartedly to welcome people and fresh ideas in, if sometimes to press uncom-\nfortably (one intends, salutarily) against the inevitable changes they will bring”\nRecently, though, the voices of digital humanities (DH) have been discordant, talk-\ning of pioneers and parvenus, makers and tweeters, workers and lurkers. Others—\nnotoriously—have figured themselves as the out-group to DH’s in-group, the dull\nground against which the “stars” of DH shine (Pannapacker). Here, though, we will\nfocus on what I hope may be a more unifying image: the user. I will try to frame DH\nnot as a field defined by its borders, and the skills required to breach those borders,\nbut instead—in an analogy that should appeal to the community’s tool builders—as\na system with users. This can help us to make some important moves. It allows us\nto shift the debate from charged hermeneutics (“Are DHers inclusive?”) to practi-\ncal heuristics (“Which features of DH as a system enhance or undermine access and\nparticipation?”). It compels us to acknowledge that DH, as a system, has serious\nusability issues that affect both new and experienced users. And it suggests how these\nproblems, contingent as they are on the system’s current design, might be addressed.\n\nUsability has typically been defined and evaluated in terms of a system’s ease\nof learning, ease of use, efficiency, and user satisfaction.! How, though, can this be\nrelevant to an academic field? If DH is a system, any academic discipline is a sys-\ntem. Should entry to a discipline, use of its theories and methods, be “easy”? Wil-\nliam Pannapacker finds DH inaccessible: “It’s perceptible in the universe of Twitter:\nWe read it, but we do not participate.

Yet surely also a field that\nmarks its difference as the “digital” owes some explanation not just of what can be\naccomplished digitally but also of how those digital moves are to be made. Human-\nists are summoned by DHers to “build” (Ramsay “On Building”), enjoined by others\nto “be online or be irrelevant” (Parry), implicitly deprecated in the title of Patricia\nCohen’s New York Times coverage, “Humanities 2.0. But, as we will find, the gate-\nways to participation, even the paths to the gateways, are obscure.\n\nThere are other ways, however, in which the concept of usability can be seen\nas problematic, both in itself and in its application here. As a business practice,\nusability and user experience (UX) design claims success in directing the user to a\nspecific end: adoption of a site, retention on the site to view ads, seamless comple-\ntion of commercial transactions. What implications might this have for DH? Pan-\nnapacker likens the atmospherics of DH to the “alienating” culture of Big Theory\nin the 1980s and 1990s, so I invoke one of the biggest theorists of the period per-\nhaps inadvisedly. But Derrida has reminded. us, “Metaphor is never innocent. It\norients research and fixes results” (17). And this particular metaphor could involve\nsome risk. Does it (as does, arguably, the entire project of usability) subscribe to a\nnaive determinism that draws a straight line between wireframe design and desired\noutcome? Does it rest on an undertheorized, instrumental conception of technol-\nogy that seeks only to achieve a smooth, seductive fit of tool to hand? After all, the\nusability.gov home page ventriloquizes the user: “Please don’t make me think!” This\nsummons in turn a nightmare vision: the user as consumer, passive and unreflec-\ntive. This figure, with the crass n00b,’ haunts texts such as “Eternal September” and\nthe comments thereon. By corollary, does viewing DH as a system render DH as\n“applied” (versus “pure”) humanities, submitting to the service orientation that\nNowviskie in her post explicitly resists? Does it, in other words, offer up DH as a\nprosthesis for the humanities to wield?\n\nTo me, these questions are not mere artifacts of the metaphor but deeply rele-\nvant as DH moves forward. Pannapacker’s post claims to mark the moment of the\nfield’s transformation from “the next big thing” to simply “The Thing”; his headline\nposits DH as “triumphant.” While common sense argues skepticism here, nonethe-\nless DH does seem to have reached a pivot point in its development. “Eternal Sep-\ntember” references the moment in 1993 when Usenet, a discussion system favored\nby early adopters, was inundated by naive users introduced by the mainstream ser-\nvice provider AOL. But we are also given a glimpse of the user experience: “about\nthirty days in, newbies had either acclimatized to Usenet or they had dropped away.”\nUntil recently even DH’s tool builders have paid scant attention to usability, as Mat-\nthew Kirschenbaum notes in his discussion of the topic, “So the Colors Cover the\nWires.” Now, though, DH does seem to be changing in response to its new users, as\nwe will see. But in offering alternatives for users beyond compliance and abandon-\nment, how will the role of those users be conceived? What forms of participation\nwill be enabled?

Yet DH’s direction in this\nregard is far from clear.\n\nTraditionally, the most common methods of usability assessment are formal\ntesting—in which selected representative users are observed interacting with the\nsystem to perform specified tasks, sometimes in a lab environment—and heuristic\nevaluation, where an expert reviews the system’s interface against a set of best prac-\ntices. This essay, I freely admit, does neither. Instead, it traces a history of the user\nin DH, before turning to examine DH as system. More recent thinking on usabil-\nity shifts the emphasis from system to user and her lived experience of the system\nin its context of use (McCarthy and Wright, 5).* So as the essay explores the online\nlandscape—the “user interface,” as it were—of the digital humanities in its current\ndesign, it focuses on reading traces of users’ situated experiences in blog posts, in\ncomment threads, and on Twitter, then lays out this user’s informal analysis of the\nresults. I will propose that DH and its possible futures are likely to be shaped, delim-\nited, or advanced by how DHers choose to design and build their conceptions of the\nuser, and the extent to which all users can participate in that process.\n\nDH and Its Users; or, Missing Masses?\n\nA UX designer typically begins by asking two basic questions: who is to use the sys-\ntem, and for what ends? It need hardly be said that regarding DH these are contested\npoints; for evidence, we can simply look at Pannapacker’s blog post, the multiple\ndefinitions of DH generated every year by the University of Alberta’s international\nDay of Digital Humanities event, and indeed this collection itself. But the responses\nto these questions have also changed over time. As Patrik Svensson describes in\n“Humanities Computing as Digital Humanities,” the field in its initial expression\n(humanities computing) had very different “epistemic commitments” from those\narticulated under the rubric of “digital humanities, and the renaming is far from\nunproblematic. Indeed DH can be seen, perhaps, as a legacy application that at its\ncore was not designed for widespread use and that struggles to integrate more recent\nmodules that have this as their goal.\n\nThe origin story of DH tells of a stand-alone tool developed initially for a sin-\ngle user, Roberto Busa—his Index Thomisticus, a concordance of the works of St.\nThomas Aquinas (Hockey). Looking at DH tools literally rather than metaphori-\ncally, they have often been designed by researchers for researchers (often them-\nselves). As even prominent tool builders acknowledge, the uptake for many DH\ntools has remained small, the users almost coextensive with the makers, even where\nthe goal of the development team has been to reach a broader audience. Multiple\nexplanations for this have been offered from within the field. The lack of enthusiasm\namong “traditional” humanists for computer-assisted textual analysis, for example,\nis often explained by a humanistic tendency to associate computation with empiri-\ncism, positivism, and other such suspect enterprises (Mueller; Ramsay, “In Praise of\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:57 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 215\n\f"

John Bradley, however, points to the system design, suggesting “comput-\ning humanists” and their “colleagues down the hall” have different mental models of\nthe role of computing in literary study. The latter are, even now, operating under the\n“conduit model” in which the computer is simply a text delivery mechanism. Com-\nputing humanists, meanwhile, have built tools based on their own models, models\nthat do not reflect how “traditional” literary scholars actually do their work. What-\never the cause, the effect seems clear. Martin Mueller conducted a distant reading\nof the titles of monographs and articles in scholarly journals, his aim being to mea-\nsure mainstream interest in what he terms “literary informatics.” He concludes that\nit remains a niche activity, of interest only to those who participate in it. It has had,\nhe says—and he is deeply involved in such work—“virtually no impact on major\ndisciplinary trends” (305).\n\nWidening the lens to DH more generally, Oya Rieger’s newer research supports\nMueller’s conclusions. In her study of faculty at Cornell’s Society for the Humani-\nties, Rieger asked about their familiarity with the digital humanities. The results:\nonly four of forty-five participants were actually engaged in what they regarded as\nDH work; four more had an understanding of it; nineteen had heard the phrase but\ncouldi’t explain its meaning; and the rest were entirely unfamiliar with the term.\nShe found, moreover, that the scholarly practices of the participants were unal-\ntered, aside from the adoption of generic tools such as search engines—technology\nas conduit, to use Bradley's term. Meanwhile, “many tools and techniques that are\nbeing associated with sophisticated digital practices, such as data mining or visual-\nization, remain accessible and relevant to only a handful of scholars.” Of course, it\nis entirely possible that with recent coverage of DH in venues such as the Chroni-\ncle of Higher Education and the New York Times*\nthat coverage—the figures Rieger quotes may now have changed. But based on the\n\n \n\nand the propulsive rhetoric of\n\nhistory of the field one might have real skepticism about DH’s potential to attract,\nlet alone retain, the deluge of new users that “Eternal September” images. On this\nview, in fact, Eternal September may be moot.\n\nRecently, however, some DHers have adopted a more inclusive mode of tool\nbuilding, as Tom Scheinfeldt describes. “At CHNM,” he writes, “we judge our tools\nby one key metric above all others: use. Successful tools are tools that are used. . .\nany open source software project’s goal should be use by as many of its potential\nusers as possible” (“Lessons from One Week | One Tool”). This, he explains, brings\nmany benefits to the project:\n\nA large and enthusiastic user base is key to a successful open source software\nproject’s continued success. If people use a product, they will invest in that prod-\nuct. They will provide valuable user testing. They will support the project in its\nefforts to secure financial support. They will help market the product, creating\na virtuous circle. Sustainability, even for free software, is grounded in a commit-\nted customer base.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:57 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

But it is a per-\nsuasive one, not least to funding agencies. Instead of, or in addition to, developing\nbespoke tools designed to serve a small group of researchers at single institutions\nvia discrete projects, DHers may increasingly develop products aimed at large num-\nbers of users across institutions and outside the academy. And with the attention\nto usability and outreach that Scheinfeldt describes, such initiatives may very well\nattract new users not just to the tools themselves but also to DH in general. But\nthis trajectory raises two critical questions regarding the newcomers: First, can DH\naccommodate them, and if so, how? And second, how do they relate to the field? We\nwill turn to the first issue shortly. As to the second, we should acknowledge that even\nas funding for DH efforts is being justified by recourse to usage, it is far from clear\nhow DH’s new users will map onto the field. Do they even have a place within it?\n\nRieger’s study of faculty in the humanities begins by commenting on the “rich-\nness and diversity” of existing discussions of DH but notes that “what seem to be\nmissing are accounts from a wide range of scholars who are not characterized as\n‘doing digital humanities’; this lack, indeed, is the driver for her work. Not coin-\ncidentally, however, accounts of them are also missing. Thanks to its name, those\nin the field struggle to name those conceived as outside it: are they “traditional,” or\n“analog,” humanists? And if we examine the emergent folksonomy of DH, it is dif-\nficult to find a term that those others might identify with. Here, for instance, is how\nMatthew Jockers of Stanford Literary Lab parses the field: “Group ‘A’ is composed\nof researchers who study digital objects; Group ‘B’ is composed of researchers who\nutilize digital tools to study objects (digital or otherwise).” Group B accommodates\nuse, it is true, but Jockers’s emphasis is on research; it does not explicitly account for\nother modes, such as work that focuses on pedagogy. We should note that his post\nis occasioned by an encounter with the other, a colleague who “asked in all earnest-\nness, ‘what do I need to do to break into this field of Digital Humanities?” This is a\nreminder that the metaphor of the lab, ubiquitous in DH, has its own associations:\nexperimentation and collaboration are there, to be sure, but it also conjures a bright\npristine working environment sealed to all but the eminently qualified. To general-\nize, most humanists are not in the habit of breaking into laboratories.\n\nIt is understandable, perhaps, but surely not inevitable that “traditional”\nhumanists are defined by exclusion. In fact, as Svensson notes, it is rather strange:\n“ifthe methodology and tools are central to the enterprise it seems counter-intuitive\nto disassociate yourself from many of the potential users (and co-creators) of the\ntools” (49). The effect is that these users become visible only if we trace the outlines\nof the negative space created by DH’s self-definitions.

We can see this when Patrick Murray-John describes a\n“mini-collaboration” on Twitter in which he (a programmer) and Mark Sample (a\nconfessed nonprogrammer) debugged and tested a widget he had built, concluding\nthat this is how he thinks DH will “work and develop”: “collaborations—on what-\never scale—between humanists at different positions on the ‘Iam a coder’—‘T ain't\na coder’ spectrum.” And scholar-builder Stéfan Sinclair tweets,° “I would add to @\nsramsay’s post that there can be a fine (and oftentimes porous) line between using\nand building.” By contrast, one could suggest that part of the shock that the recent\nunanticipated release of Google’s text analysis tool, the Ngram Viewer, administered\nto the DH community was its abrupt demotion of skilled makers in the text analy-\nsis domain to read-only end. users of the tool’s limited affordances.

But we will also test another of his arguments—\none that, like this essay, proposes an analogy. “Digital humanities takes more than\ntools from the Internet,” he writes (“Stuff Digital Humanists Like”). “It works like\nthe Internet. It takes its values from the Internet.” These values are built into the\nvery architecture of the web, which, he explains, emphasizes the nodes rather than\nthe network as sources of innovation, assuming “that the network should be dumb\nand the terminals should be smart.” And just as the Internet functions by trusting\nthose nodes to distribute the information sent to them, so does DH: “we allow all\ncomers, we assume that their contributions will be positive, and we expect that they\n\nwill share their work for the benefit of the community at large” (ibid.).\n\nWe will see, though, that the vision Scheinfeldt describes is as yet incompletely\nrealized in DH’s system design. Rather it is unevenly distributed, and the user finds\nherself falling into the gaps between that vision and her everyday experience of\nthe field. This is not because DHers do not subscribe to the values that Scheinfeldt\n\narticulates. On the contrary, many in the community are working hard to improve\n\n \n\nDH’s outreach and infrastructure. But Lisa Spiro’s essay in this collection has as its\npremise the observation that DH has not, to date, cohered as a community around\na set of shared values. And the implementation of values in system design is nei-\nther commonplace nor a straightforward transaction. Even researchers whose work\nspecifically focuses on values in technology design have noted that, while design for\nusability is by now thoroughly mainstream, “we are still at the shaky beginnings of\nthinking systematically about the practice of designing with values in mind” (Fla-\nnagan, Howe, and Nissenbaum, 323). As our exploration of the DH user experience\nwill show, the current design presents real challenges for both new and established\nusers and in practice strains against the values DHers endorse.\n\nGOOGLING THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES\n\nLet’s begin with an experiment. Asked recently to address the question “What Is\nDigital Humanities and What's It Doing in English Departments?” Matt Kirschen-\nbaum told his audience, “It’s tempting to say that whoever asks the question has\nnot gone looking very hard for an answer.” (In a comment on the associated blog\npost he is blunter still, writing of “intellectual laziness.”) He characterizes DH as\nhaving a “robust professional apparatus” that is “easily discoverable” and demon-\nstrates this by Googling the term and consulting its entry in Wikipedia. If we fol-\nlow his example we can certainly get a sense of the field: Googie lists first (at time of\nwriting) the Wikipedia entry for digital humanities, then the Association of Digital\nHumanities Organizations (ADHO) site, Digital Humanities Quarterly, the Digital\nHumanities 2011 conference (titled “Big Tent Digital Humanities”), two entries for\nthe National Endowment for the Humanities’s Office of Digital Humanities, and\nso on.

This also means that smaller projects—\nespecially those addressing topics that are underrepresented in the field—continue\nto be hidden from view.\n\nThe presence of any “big tent” to unite DH’s disparate parts is also far from\napparent. Currently, at least, there is no site that explains, advocates, and showcases\nwork of the DH community, in its full range, to all its potential audiences (gen-\neral public, faculty, students, curators, librarians, administrators, funders, and so\non), that invites users in and helps them navigate the field. And surveying the sites\nthat users might reach from the Wikipedia page, Google's search results, and the\nADHO’s list of resources, very few set their work explicitly in the context of the digi-\ntal humanities, articulate their mission in terms that are accessible to a broader audi-\nence, or link to other sites in the community.’ Institutional, not shared, identity is\nto the fore; as Neil Fraistat, director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the\nHumanities (MITH), acknowledges in his contribution to this collection, the major\nDH institutions “rarely collaborate with other centers, with whom they compete for\nfunding and prestige.” It is not surprising, then, that it’s hard to detect a feeling of\ncommunity in the search results and that they reflect instead DH’s fragmentation.\nBut from a user's perspective, the lack of connective tissue between even key com-\nponents of DH means that Google is actually essential to navigate the field—the\nproblem being that to Google something one already needs to know that it exists.\n\nIn his discussion of “Inclusion in the Digital Humanities,” Geoffrey Rockwell\nhas argued for both maintaining DH as a commons (we will return to this con-\ncept in a moment) and creating “well-articulated onramps”—professional training,\ngraduate programs, and so on—that will allow people to access it. But signposts to\nthe commons, to the on-ramps, are also needed. to make them discoverable by the\nvery people who need them most.

Twitter's\nasymmetric follow model does provide extraordinary access to DH’s “stars,” along\nwith a weaker version of the seductive telepresence familiar from earlier modes such\nas instant messaging.

Here, for instance, are a couple of tweets from Kathleen Fitzpatrick\":\n“Some weeks back somebody wrote a great post about returning to blogging from\nTwitter as a means of creating a more permanent archive .. . but now I can’t track\nthat post down. (Irony? Perhaps.) Anyhow, if you remember that post, would you\nlet me know? Thanks!” David Berry has likened Twitter to the stock ticker, noting\nthe impact of the ticker on its users when it was introduced in the late nineteenth\ncentury. Users were reported to have entered a trance-like state, marked by “atten-\ntion, vigilance and constant observation.” Coping with a real-time feed of the kind\nof information that flows across the DH network, however—information that users\nactually may want to retain—is very demanding. And users absent themselves at a\ncost, as Fitzpatrick notes!!: “Funny how far out of the loop I now feel if I spend a\nday offline.’ For information capture, Twitter is a mode better suited to the flaneur\nthan the DH bricoleur. In “So the Colors Cover the Wires,” Kirschenbaum recalls\nthe “baroque array of spoofs, tricks, workarounds, fixes, and kludges” that charac-\nterized web development in the mid-1990s (with the uneven results that spawned\nthe usability industry). But nostalgia for that moment may be premature: every\nday, hundreds of individual acts of writing to storage take place, using our own\n“baroque array” of practices—favoriting, bookmarking, RSSing, archiving, harvest-\ning, extracting—all subject to the whims of Twitter’s infrastructure and changing\nbusiness practices. This is part of the invisible work of keeping up with DH, tedious\nbut necessary, inefficient and seemingly inevitable, since it is built into the current\nsystem design.”\n\nWRITING THE DIGITAL HUMANITIES: CENTERS AND NODES\n\nThe centerless, distributed nature of the Internet that Scheinfeldt references gives\nit its flexibility and extensibility, its resilience and failover capabilities. And it is an\nimportant feature of DH, for the same reasons. In his post “On the Death of the Dig-\nital Humanities Center,’ Mark Sample fears for the future of the DH center, and we\nknow that his fears are justified. Only recently, Transcribe Bentham, an exemplary\nproject, announced that it had exhausted the funding that supports its public out-\nreach and collaboration efforts.'? Sample advises us, “Act as if there’s no such thing as\nadigital humanities center.” We should instead form our own networks and alliances\noutside established institutional structures: “To survive and thrive, digital human-\nists must be agile, mobile, insurgent. Decentralized and nonhierarchical. Centers,\nno. Camps, yes.” But a commenter, Kathy, raises a critical issue: “Ok, Mark, this is\ngreat advice. But, how will those camps and discrete collaborative relationships have\nany wider impact? Everyone will re-invent the wheel every time?” The problems\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:57 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 223\n\f"

Whether DH centers proliferate\nor etiolate, DH has no center, and this, to my view, is its biggest usability problem.\n\nDH’s weak front end complicates the user’s ability to discover and navigate the\nsystem as a whole, as we have seen. The field’s reliance on Twitter as a backbone for\nscholarly communication renders key inforrnation only fragmentarily and fleet-\ningly readable, requiring individual users’ persistence to make it persistent. But the\ncenterless model, to be effective, relies on a seamless interoperability that simply\ndoes not exist in DH. Like the other issues we have explored, this has very practi-\ncal implications. As Kim Knight reports in her MLA 2011 talk for a panel on “The\nInstitution(alization) of Digital Humanities,” the diffusion of what she calls DH’s\n“ecology” means that “one must actively traverse the terrain of the ecology, looking\nfor connections, all of the time.” She is “100% certain,” she says, that there is work\ngoing on in her area of specialization of which she is totally unaware. In fact, DH is\nan enormously complex, multifunction, distributed system that is largely undocu-\nmented. There are of course many rich resources available—the Digital Research\nTools (DiRT) wiki, for example, or the supporting information provided by the Text\nEncoding Initiative, to give just two examples. (We will see more.) But without some\nkind of shared knowledge base, such resources are very hard to find. And users need\nto be able to find information before they can read it.'* Under these circumstances,\nif new users ask the same questions again and again, if we reinvent the wheel (and\nwe do), who can blame us? No wonder the dread of Eternal September: a forum\nsuch as DHAnswers is the place where people go when they fail to find an answer\nto their questions in the user documentation; it is not usually the first port of call.\n\nWhere we can point to DH projects, information about how they were made is\ntypically not available; this is true even of open-source work. Jeremy Boggs, a DH\nscholar-builder, writes in his post “Participating in the Bazaar: Sharing Code in the\nDigital Humanities,’ “I would argue that, right now, the digital humanities is get-\nting really good at shopping/browsing at the bazaar, but not actually sharing. We\nseem to have no problem using open source tools and applications, but very rarely\nare we actually giving back, or making the development and sharing of open source\ncode a central part of our work.’ Sample proposes that DH centers can and do act\nas a “Digital Humanities Commons,’ for “knowledge and resources we can all share\nand build upon.” But Kathy counters, “It’s not happening yet, the sharing.” When\nusers do attempt to share information, many of them, especially those outside of\nthe major centers, have nowhere to put it. Users—including users at the margins—\nconsistently create things of value for the DH community. Here are just a few small\nexamples from recent months: a Google document collating knowledge on tran-\nscribing documents generated at MITH’s Application Programming Interface (API)\nworkshop in February 2011, another from THATCamp Texas 2011 with a rich col-\nlection of links and thoughts related to DH pedagogy, Sheila Brennan's list of sugges-\ntions on “Navigating DH for Cultural Heritage Professionals, and CUNY’s Digital\nHumanities Resource Guide.

The design of the system, its lack of a writeable\ncore, militates against one of the most prized virtues of system building: reuse. And\nonce again this problem disproportionately affects the newest and least connected\nusers. To be clear, Pm not advocating here a command and control model—quite\nthe reverse. But for DH to be truly usable, the center needs to be smart enough to\nenable the nodes to be smarter.\n\nShaping the Digital Humanities\n\nLearning about the digital humanities, navigating the field, communicating across\nit, contributing to it—all these things are difficult in DH, as we have seen. The prob-\nlems users face are not mere annoyances, though, as they may appear to some expert\nusers; in each case they work to inhibit access and undermine community. There is\ndanger, however, in proposing design as a solution here, even beyond the determin-\nism this would imply. In naming DH an “ecology” Knight captures the anxiety that\naccompanies this moment in DH’s evolution. The messiness of DH, like any ecology\nis, she writes, its “condition of existence.” What impact might a designed interven-\ntion have? This tension exists in regard to usability, too. For Jakob Nielsen, one of\nthe movement's leading protagonists, usability is a website’s “condition for survival”\n(“Usability 101”). But it has also been associated with a dogmatic excess of design.\nClay Shirky, for instance, has argued that Nielsen’s demands for standardization\nare too prescriptive and would be a homogenizing force that stifles the web’s natu-\nral modes of growth and innovation: “The Internet’s ability to be adapted slowly,\nimperfectly, and in many conflicting directions all at once is precisely what makes it\nso powerful.” There is much creativity in the act of kludging. Outside institutionally\nendorsed DH centers, indeed, DH could be viewed end to end as a grand kludge,\nwith users improvising tools, techniques, funding, project teams, and career paths\nto advance their larger visions. What might be lost in systematizing DH’s ecosystem?\n\nOn the other hand, can we assume that DH will maintain homeostasis in a way\nthat balances the needs of all its users? So far, it has not. Nielsen states that a usabil-\nity test with only five users will discover 85 percent of the design problems in a sys-\ntem; many more than five users experience DH as exclusive. At THATCamp SoCal\n2011, held just after the MLA Convention ended, participants created a position\nstatement that reads, in full,\n\nWe recognize that a wide diversity of people is necessary to make digital haman-\nities function.

While in Knight's view, the primary\nthreat to DH’s ecology is “the process of discipline formation,” DH is not as undisci-\nplined as it seems. Not only does it have the “professional apparatus” that Kirschen-\nbaum describes, but its “daily voicing” has inevitably settled into habitual practices.\nPerhaps the bigger threat is that DH’s disciplinary formations might solidify around\nunrecognized inequities.\n\nLf we were to propose a design for DH, then, where might we look for a model?\nSeveral analogies have been offered in the course of this piece: DH has appeared as\nUsenet, as Twitter, as the Internet itself. I will suggest one more. In “Lessons from\nOne Week | One Tool,” Scheinfeldt shares his prescriptions for a successful open-\nsource development community: “open communication channels, . .. access to the\nproject’s development road map” so developers know where their work is most\nneeded, and “technical entry points” where they can “hone their chops on small\nbits of functionality before digging into the core code base.” Most of all, they need\n“a sense of community, a sense of shared purpose, and a sense that their volunteer\ncontributions are valued.” All of this, he tells us, must be “planned, managed, and\nbuilt into the software architecture” (ibid.). A visit to Omeka.org or WordPress.org\nshows such a community in action—a community that, as we discussed. earlier,\nincludes the full range of users, from novices to experienced programmers. These\nsites speak to all users, showcase what is possible using the software, provide forums\nand rich user documentation; they not only invite the user to “get involved” but\nguide her to specific ways she can contribute according to her skill set. Importantly,\nas the WordPress site tells us, “Everything you see here, from the documentation to\nthe code itself, was created by and for the community.”\n\nIt might seem uncontroversial, anodyne even, to propose the open-source soft-\nware development model as a paradigm for DH. But much as it is employed and\ninvoked within the field, key enabling features are not yet embodied in the system’s\ndesign, as we have seen. If there were a DH road map, for example, where would it be?\nWho would have created it? Who would know about it, and how? There are lessons\nhere for DH. For one thing, in very practical terms, we might suggest that a shared\nknowledge base on the example of WordPress’s documentation wiki, the Codex—a\nDH Codex, if you like—could alleviate much of the difficulty of the current user\nexperience: making information findable, lifting the communication burden from\nDH’s “stars,” and providing the ability for anyone to contribute, so that the field\nwould truly reflect the range of its participants’ concerns. Such a space, a true DH\nCommons, could have larger implications, however. It could reify not institutional\nstructures but radical interdisciplinariness, supporting both weak forms of collabo-\nration, such as linking and commenting, and strong collaboration through shared\ndevelopment of resources. It could offer a loose and simple framework that would\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:57 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Fortunately, a system cannot legislate behavior or\nlesire. McCarthy and Wright note that users “appropriate the physical and concep-\ntual space created by producers for their own interests and needs; they are not just\npassive consumers” (11). Users will navigate their own paths through the interface\nof DH, paths of innovation and resistance. Another possibility, of course, is that\nthey will not use the system at all. Notwithstanding the claims of usability consul-\ntants, adoption is stubbornly unpredictable. Laura Mitchell, a commenter on Perian\nSully’s post, draws a telling parallel with gender studies, her own area of expertise:\n“Despite at least 40 years of exacting scholarship, gender remains a sub-field, a fun-\nlamental aspect of human social existence that scholars can choose to ignore if they\nwant to. And DH?” The analogy DH’s critics like to make is with Big Theory, and\nthis is the implication: that one day we will look back on DH as just another wave\nthat broke over the academy, eroded its formations perhaps in some small places,\nand then receded, leaving a few tranquil rock pools behind. Mitchell’s concern is that\nthe skills newcomers need to acquire form a real barrier to entering DH and thus\nwill limit its reach. The open-source model, however, suggests that our field’s cur-\nrent focus on qualification, on boundary setting, is unnecessary and that the choice\nbetween emptying the term “digital humanities” of meaning on the one hand and\nefending it as specialist redoubt on the other is a false one. Instead it offers another\nvision: that by working, individually and collectively, to adopt and actively enable a\n\n \n\nexible and extensible conception of the user, we can include all comers as diverse\nactors in the network of DH.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.

Playing with\nelectronic toys is not scholarship. Where are your peer-reviewed articles?” I know\nfrom experience that there are plenty of people in the profession who know little\nabout this established field and even regard it with disdain as something disturb-\ningly outré and dangerous to the mission of the humanities. During the discus-\nsion at that session, Matthew Kirschenbaum, author of Mechanisms: New Media\nand the Forensic Imagination, which won the MLA’s First Book Award last year,\nobserved that “if you don’t know what the digital humanities is, you haven't\nlooked very hard”\n\nI mean, come on, just start with the Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/\nwiki/Digital_humanities. The digital humanities are not some flashy new theory\nthat might go out of fashion. At this point, the digital humanities are “the thing”\nThere’s no “next” about it. And it won't be long until the digital humanities are,\nquite simply, “the humanities.”\n\nConsider the quantity, quality, and comprehensiveness of the digital humani-\nties panels at this year’s MLA convention.’\n\nThe digital humanities have some internal tensions, such as the occasional\ndivide between builders and theorizers and coders and noncoders. But the field, as\na whole, seems to be developing an in-group, out-group dynamic that threatens to\nreplicate the culture of Big Theory back in the 80s and 90s, which was alienating to\nso many people. It’s perceptible in the universe of Twitter: we read it, but we do not\nparticipate. It’s the cool kids’ table.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:57 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 233\n\f"

And maybe\nmost important of all: there’s money, most obviously represented by Brett Bobley\nfrom the NEH’s Office of Digital Humanities—looking just a little like Jeff Gold-\nblum in Jurassic Park.\n\nIf this keeps up, I might start wearing ironic T-shirts under my black sport coat.\n\nThere’s justice in this turn of events: well-earned success for a community that\nhas long regarded itself as facing uncomprehending resistance. At the same time,\nthe tendency to become like Big Theory may change the attractive ethics of the field,\ndescribed. by one panelist “as community, collaboration, and goodwill” The grass-\nroots days seem to be ending.\n\nAs this process develops, how will it affect the majority of the profession,\nthose who teach at community colleges, for-profit schools, and teaching-intensive\ninstitutions? The growing tendency of the digital humanities to become an elite\ncommunity—always pursuing the cutting edge—may leave most of us behind,\nstruggling to catch up with limited support; and humanities education, in gen-\neral, will be unchanged. by the innovation and excitement promised. by the digital\nhumanities at this year’s MLA convention.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis chapter originally appeared as “Pannapacker at MLA: Digital Humanities Trium-\nphant?” (http://chronicle.com/blogs/brainstorm/pannapacker-at-mla-digital- humanities\n-triumphant/30915).\n\n1. http://www.hastac.org/blogs/marksample/digital-humanities-sessions-201 1-mla.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:57 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

One (the rarest) is simple enthusiasm; though\nit’s interesting that presumably few women applied and none of their projects were\ncompelling enough to fund. Another is trepidation: Is this too hardcore? Involving\ntoo much math or statistical analysis I never learned? Do I understand the scholarly\npossibilities and have the support network Pd need?

We are very, very good at blaming others for our mar-\nginalization. I truly believe that most universities would be entirely grateful for\na visionary humanities program that addressed the critical needs of literacies for\nthe twenty-first century.

(Who can blame a disci-\npline?} The problem is its members. We are insufferable. We do not want change.\nWe do not want centrality. We do not want to speak to nor interact with the world.\nWe mistake the tiny pastures of private ideals with the megalopolis of real lives. We\nspin from our mouths retrograde dreams of the second coming of the nineteenth\ncentury while simultaneously dismissing out of our sphincters the far more earnest\nambitions of the public at large—religion, economy, family, craft, science.\n\nHumanists work hard but at all the wrong things, the commonest of which is\nthe fetid fester of a hypothetical socialist dream world, one that has become far more\ndisconnected with labor and material than the neoliberalism it claims to replace.\n\nHumanism does not deserve to carry the standard for humans, for frankly it\ndespises them.\n\nWe dort make reform our mission because we secretly hate the idea of par-\ntaking of and in the greater world, even as we purport to give it voice, to speak of\nits ills through critical esoterics no public ear could ever grasp.

Scholarly edi-\ntions are, in their methodology and form, not unchanging, nor are their under-\nlying conceptions simple. This essay is, in response, a reflection on the\nopportunities that the digital form potentially offers editors about how they\nmay gain traction by taking advantage of the capacities and logic of the new\nmedium. The main proposal stems from leaving the representational question on\nhold (how the edition represents the work and the methodologies used to achieve\nthat) and instead considering the edition primarily as a transaction with its\nreaders—those print-counterparts of the digital crowd. The history of post-war\nscholarly editions is reviewed for its evolving understandings of the reader-user.\nThen a conceptual separation between the archive and the edition is proposed so\nthat a new, more reader-oriented definition of editorial responsibilities can be\nenvisaged for digital scholarly editions—something that the logic of the print\n\n \n   \n \n\nmedium forbade.\n\nNow that we are challenged by the prospect of\ncrowd-sourcing being extended to databases, textual\narchives, and, it is claimed, even to scholarly edi-\ntions—my special subject here—it is necessary to\nrevisit some old debates and ask what regard has\nbeen paid to the crowd in the past. Scholarly editions\nthat served as both textual archive and edition, thus\n\nsati\n\n \n\ning the needs of scholars, together with clear\nreading texts able to be reused without change in\ngeneral-reader and student editions, was the old\nand straightforward solution. This seemed fine and\nobvious in the New Critical postwar period, and\nthere was no feasible alternative in any case.\nAlready sophisticated book cross-referencing systems\ngrew even more sophisticated, and thus able to\nhandle both the editorial and archival functions of\nprinted editions, even as unexpectedly challenging\ntextual scenarios began to be encountered by the\neditors of modern works.'

            "result": "P. Eggert\n\nwhen they sparked dispute by significantly altering\nthe received text, scholarly editions rarely gained\ntraction in the broader literary scene, for they ad-\ndressed a market—a ‘crowd’—that was tiny. There\nare reasons for that predicament that I turn to\nbelow, and there have been exceptions in the post-\nwar period. But the charge remains largely true that\nthese highly reliable, sometimes magnificent vehicles\nof textuality were and remain under-used.\n\nThe inherent worth of a scholarly pursuit should\nnot, of course, be judged purely by the width of the\ndemographic that profits by it. The generation of\nnew knowledge is worthwhile for its own sake; its\nafter-effects are hard to predict; and the aura of mag-\nnificence, even if one never achieves it, remains an\ninspiration and a goal for editors during those thou-\nsands of hours that a scholarly edition takes to pre-\npare. A literary work opens itself up in miraculously\ndetailed ways for an editor, as it rarely does for\nanyone else. ‘Social’ traction for this sense of discov-\nery is nevertheless highly to be desired. Thus, now\nthat we have a digital medium for which the needful\ntools are at last being written, the question may be\nasked: will things change for the better, and how??\n\nThe conference of 2013 at which an earlier ver-\nsion of this essay was presented specifically addressed\none application of the new flexibilities enticingly\noffered by the digital medium: the crowd-sourcing\nof digital scholarly editions.’ An article published in\nLiterary and Linguistic Computing in 2012 by Ray\nSiemens and various co-authors had in some ways\nset the agenda (Siemens et al., 2012). Although the\narticle was a much-workshopped piece intended to\ncreate the groundwork for a computational model-\nling of the social scholarly edition, some crucial ab-\nsences in its reasoning undermine the ambit it claims\nfor itself. To my mind, as a practising editor, the\nfundamentals of the scholarly edition are oddly\nignored. It is almost as if the group of co-authors\nhad mistaken their quarry: that they were making an\noffer to model the digital scholarly edition without\ntaking full cognizance of the understandings on\nwhich scholarly editing is based.”\n\nDebate about what editions are and do is as old\nas the Library of Alexandria, and it is in the nature\nof such debate never to be finalized. Scholarly edi-\ntions are, in their methodology and form, not\n\nunchanging, nor are their underlying conceptions\nsimple. Thus they do not stand still, passively offer-\ning themselves up as unproblematic objects for,\nnow, computer modelling, even if, until now, their\nimposing book formats may have given rise to this\nassumption. Editions reflect and respond to theories\nabout what works are, what texts are, and what\ndocuments are, and these theories  shift.°\nUndoubtedly, too, the textual landscape to which\neditions have in some way to correspond will be\nrefreshed by the advent of the digital edition. This\nessay is, in response, a reflection on the opportu-\nnities that their digital form potentially offers—\nabout how they may gain traction by taking advan-\ntage of the capacities and logic of the new medium.\nMy main proposal stems from leaving the represen-\ntational question on hold (how the edition repre-\nsents the work and the methodologies used to\nachieve that) and considering the edition instead\nprimarily as a transaction with its readers—those\nprint-counterparts of the digital crowd.\n\n1 The Print-Editorial Inheritance\n\nFirst, the obvious question has to be asked: Is there\nany help to be found with articulating this transac-\ntional nature of the edition in the divergent trad-\nitions of German and Anglo-American scholarly\nediting?” What is to be sought after, wrote the lead-\ning German editorial theorist Hans Zeller in 1971, is\nthe ‘objectification of editing’ (Zeller, 1995, p. 54).\nAlthough at the time some anglophone editors\nseemed to be saying something similar in claiming\ndefinitiveness as their aim and entertaining the term\n‘scientific to describe the regularities of their\nGregian methodology,* the basically critical nature\nof their adjudication of variant readings in the es-\ntablishment of a reading text meant that objectifi-\ncation was, strictly speaking, unattainable. Anglo-\nAmerican editors were prepared to draw readings\nfrom different documents to approximate the text\nof final authorial intention. For their part, German\neditors refused to mix up the historical witness of\ndifferent documents, appealing instead to the\nPrague structuralist definition of text-as-system.\nOnce any component of it, no matter how small,\n\n798 = Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016\n\n//p/ LEfOHuB/yspAUOO dno olWeDBOBy:sdyy Woy DaDBOjUMOG)\n\n2\n\nO8Z/26.\n\nZOZ Jequesec] go vO sasn Assign] Ausueaiuip euuaia Ag 9096:\n\n8\n\f"

And yet the\neditor is often the only person aware of it. It is a\nregrettable state of affairs.\n\nScholarly editors have failed to educate, and by\nthis means create, a broader readership capable of\nappreciating and using the results of their labour.\n(Or is it perhaps that editors have failed to educate\ntheir publishers in the need to devise a publishing\nbridge between the two constituencies?) Whatever\nthe case, even as their editing practice has tended\ntowards fuller and more scrupulous disclosure;\neven as scholarly editors have experimented with\nversional (rather than work) editing and with\nrecognizing sources of textual authority other\nthan final intention, their contact with readers\nhas been attenuated. How long, in print, can this\ngo on?\n\nLooked at from a print-trade point of view, the\nscholarly edition is only one of many kinds of edi-\ntion produced for sale. The scholarly edition may be\nat the reference-book end of the scale but an over-\narching orientation to the reader must encompass\nthem all, although differently expressed in each case.\nFrom this perspective it can be argued that the\nscholarly edition in print form has been failing to\ncommunicate, ironically at the very moment when it\nmay well have reached its peak in the scale and fi-\ndelity of its work-oriented achievement. There\nseems to be no solution, in print at least, to the\ntransactional deficit. Thus it prompts the question:\nAre more reader-oriented scholarly editions con-\nceivable that would not simply be a retreat to the\nold textual compromises (and editorial laziness)\nthat publishers used unthinkingly to perpetrate in\nthe past and that the New Bibliographers and then\nthe postwar scholarly editors—Fredson Bowers first\namong them in rhetorical effectiveness—so tellingly\nrebuked?\n\nThe reader-oriented scholarly edition\n\n3 The Digital Potential for\nScholarly Editions\n\nHow may the dilemma be addressed? In the print\nedition, the archival and editorial responsibilities of\nthe scholarly edition need to be given simultaneous\nand seamless expression. What changes, in the digi-\ntal medium, if we conceptually separate the two im-\npulses? Can the collection, preparation, and\norganization of the relevant digital collection of\ndocument facsimile images and_transcriptions—\nthe so-called archive—be functionally separated\nfrom the preparation of the digital edition, as the\ntwo obligations cannot be in the unitary model of\nthe print domain? If so, then the editor, lightened of\nthe archival load, might more readily address the\nevolving imperatives and concerns of the broader\nbook-historical and literary-critical scenes and thus\nengage readers in their various categories. Their at-\ntention might be directed, in one form or another,\nto the data that the edition was analysing and\ninterpreting.\n\nImmediately there is a stumbling block. Can the\narchival duty of transcription be, in actual practice,\nthus separated off so as to lend a freer hand to the\neditor? The transcription of ancient or medieval, and\nsometimes even of modern, hands can, it is well\nknown, be a highly skilled act involving interpret-\nation. It is rarely only near-mechanical copying—as\nthe distinction between recording for archival pur-\nposes and interpreting for editorial purposes may\nseem to imply. Indeed, even the simpler forms of\ntranscription for the digital medium involve some\ninterpreting of the document, even if at very low\nlevels of abstraction. Assertions need to be made,\nas they typically are in the TEI header and in the\nspecification of text elements and their attributes. A\ntranscription using an encoding scheme models, in a\nsimplified form, what is, in reception, a more com-\nplex phenomenon. Nevertheless, once these qualifi-\ncations are made, it is usually the case that there will\nbe, for any given document, forms of transcription\nthat are more open to objection (because more in-\nterpretative) and forms that are less open.\nPragmatically speaking, the adequate archival tran-\nscription may be defined as the least objectionable,\nthe one that allows contrasting editorial and other,\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016 803\n\n//p/ LEfOHuB/yspAUOO dno olWeDBOBy:sdyy Woy DaDBOjUMOG)\n\nGi.\n\nSS SSTAPE\n\nZOZ Jequesec] go vO sasn Assign] Ausueaiuip euuaia Ag 9096:\n\n8\n\f"

Eggert\n\nmore avowedly interpretative options to be built\nupon it.'*\n\nThere, at the practical level, is the boundary be-\ntween the archival and the editorial that I am seek-\ning. The two domains are perhaps better termed the\narchival impulse and the editorial impulse since\nclearly they will have commerce with one another,\nespecially if the same person is undertaking both\ntasks—as has been typically the case for the print\nedition. However, given sufficient grant funding or\nthe pre-existence online of the relevant facsimile\nimages and usable transcriptions of them, digital\nscholarly editors will only need to plan and then\nmanage the archival operation of capture, organiza-\ntion, and storage. Once the archival function has\nbeen discharged, the traditional editorial role of\nemendation and textual commentary can become\nmore prominent.’” So too, at the hands of a sensi-\ntized scholarly editor, can the testimony of literary\nhistory, biography, and book history be now liber-\nated within the edition or in close association with\nit,\n\nAlthough I cannot say exactly what forms this\nwill take, I believe that the argument for it needs\nmaking now. I feel a little like how Martin Battestin\nat the University of Virginia must have felt in 1981\nwhen he argued for the desirability of including\nexplanatory notes in scholarly editions. He was\nhaving to balance a shared conception of scholarly\nediting as ‘scientific’ (he uses and justifies the term)\nagainst the benefits of annotation, which he points\nout is obviously interpretative. His recommenda-\ntions as to how to render annotation less open to\nobjection are eminently sensible and were ad-\ndressed to an audience of fellow editors and bibli-\nographers (Battestin, 1981, p. 4). I, in turn, find\nmyself arguing for the admittance, within the digi-\ntal edition and via modes that I can only dimly\nforesee, of some closely parallel fields of interpret-\nation. I am not proposing that this broadening\nbecome the occasion for dumping into an undis-\ncriminating ragbag all that has been discovered\nabout or associated with the work, whether textual,\nhistorical, or cultural. The forms of commentary\nwill need to emerge into a disciplined discourse of\ntheir own. This will take time and experimentation\nto get right. The discipline will emerge from an\n\neditorial orientation towards the anticipated needs\nof different categories of readers.\n\nThere is a natural alliance between, for instance,\nbook history and bibliography. We need further ex-\nploration of its potential by editors. The generaliza-\ntions of book history can be focussed and may be\nsharpened and corrected by the textual evidence in\neditions. But editors have to see it as their job to do\nthis before it can become an effective editorial mode.\nThe same will be true of the period-characterizations\nof literary history. Again, the traditional divide be-\ntween literary scholarship and literary criticism,\nwhich was entrenched during the New Critical\nperiod and afterwards, has not served either side\nwell. Both sides have been impoverished by it. The\nsolution is obvious, although its modes less so.\nPerhaps through commentary of different lengths,\neach successive one opening out at more length\nfrom the preceding one, and thus aimed at different\nkinds of readers, the digital scholarly editor may be\nable to devise ways of getting out into the open the\ntextual evidence that will engage and enliven literary\ndebates. Rather as Battestin observed about the edi-\ntor’s preparation of explanatory notes (‘if his author\nis worth knowing, few will have come to know him\nbetter’ (Battestin, 1981, p. 22)), the digital scholarly\neditor is obviously in the best position to get the ball\nrolling.\n\nThe need for the edition to last 100 years—that\nultimately marketplace consideration that has af-\nfected so much scholarly work in print, both for\ngood and for bad—simply does not obtain in the\ndigital medium. Once the archival and editorial\nresponsibilities are understood as separable\n(though still interrelated), the archive can be\nopened to any future scholar to reuse for a new\nedition (or for the existing editor to revise and re-\nissue the initial edition), Will what I am describing\nbe editing as we have traditionally understood it or\nwill it be something else? It will be an expansion of\nthe role as we know it, to be sure; but, as with ex-\nplanatory notes, it must be measured by its success.\nWhy not try? The need to argue for explanatory\nnotes as late as 1981 seems historically quaint\nnow, even faintly ludicrous. What will the judge-\nment be in 40 years on digital editing having ex-\npanded into adjacent fields?

            "result": "well, the transactional value of the edition will have\nbeen enriched.\n\nNone of this means that the traditional editorial\nobligation of providing a reading text will go away.\nWhenever the existing texts of a work are shown by\nstudy to have been misshapen by the accidents of\ntime or have gone through significant phases of re-\ninvention, editorial action is called for. In the digital\nmedium, the editor's new reading text will usually\nconsist, in effect, of a list of emendations, supported\nby justifications for them, of one or more of the\ntexts already stored within the digital archive.\n\nIn this operational shift lies a conceptual shift. It\nwill apply as much to the edited text (itself argued on\nthe basis of some criterion of authority or another) as\nto the commentary, both in the ways I have just\ndescribed as well as in other ways yet to be devised.\nA digital scholarly edition will be understood, in the\nscenario ] am painting, as an argument directed ‘at’\nthe reader ‘about’ the archive, one that turns data\ninto evidence in the service of an editorial argument.\nThis is why traditional editorial responsibilities\nremain in play once the platform becomes digital\nand also why my proposal cannot be construed as\nan invitation to some new form of editorial\nlaziness.”\n\nEditors of critical editions will understand their\nactivity not as discovering the textual authority dif-\nferentially scattered amongst the work documents\nso much as proposing and arguing its presence.\nThe text or text-fragment argued to possess author-\nity will not therefore be understood to be in a one-\nto-one relationship with the work considered as\nexisting in some ideal sense but, rather, as part of\na rhetorical and semiotic unrolling of the editorial\nargument. Once we can entertain the conceptual-\nfunctional prising apart of the archival and editorial\nimpulses the scholarly edition comes into focus as\nan argument about the contents of the archive of the\nwork, not as somehow its highest culmination or as\nits teleologically pre-ordained fate. We can see now,\nI think, that it was only because the print form\nconflated the two impulses in practice, wove the\neditorial around the archival with the results 1\nhave sketched, that this false impression among\nusers of editions arose. It may have become natur-\nalized but that does not prove it was natural, and\n\nThe reader-oriented scholarly edition\n\nhere surely lies our opportunity. Among other\nthings, the history of the reading of a work as re-\ncorded within the archive will open up interpret-\native dimensions for the digital scholarly editor.\nAnd newly emerging literary-critical emphases and\nsignificances will be similarly addressable from\nwithin the edition.\n\nIf the task is understood in this way, the editor\nwill experience a sense of freedom to engage new\naudiences, some of whom may also become\ninvolved in adding to the archive. If the editor’s\nargument is persuasive, the edition will propel the\nwork further along its cultural path in reshaped or\nre-tailored textual apparel and with new supporting\ndocumentation and interpretation. The editor will\nbe seen to be editing ‘in’ the work—that is, within\nthe ongoing life of the work—not on it.”? The new\nedition will have to earn its spurs, and it will be\npossible to count the uses of that edited text in\ncomparison with the uses of the facsimile images\nof the corresponding documents and of their tran-\nscriptions. If the edition adds value to what is inde-\npendently available in the archive, readers will come\nto it. If it does not, they will not.\n\nWhat I am envisaging, then, is a more reader-\noriented scholarly edition than has been feasible in\nprint. Each edition of a work will be an argument,\npotentially one of many, pitched to readers, con-\nsciously designed as such in the digital medium.\n\nWe will also see the edition’s transactional role\nmore clearly once we plot the various forms of edi-\ntion on a continuous scale, from full-scale critical\neditions to other scholarly forms to ordinary trade\neditions, rather than considering the latter forms as\na compromise of the former’s fuller reporting. In\nthe digital environment, and once enabled by the\nconceptual separation of the archival and editorial\nfunctions, editors will more readily be able to lay the\noptions out for readers than they could in print.\nReaders will not be imprisoned by their allotted cat-\negory, as in the print domain, but be able to slide\nbetween them. Exposure of non-professional readers\nincluding students to images of the original docu-\nments and printings will doubtless provoke curiosity\nand the desire, amongst some, to go further. Who\nknows where this will lead? Surely it will be a good\nthing, and will pioneer trails of literary-critical\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016 805\n\n//p/ LEfOHuB/yspAUOO dno olWeDBOBy:sdyy Woy DaDBOjUMOG)\n\nGi.\n\nSS SSTAPE\n\nZOZ Jequesec] go vO sasn Assign] Ausueaiuip euuaia Ag 9096:\n\n8\n\f"

            "result": "808\n\nP. Eggert\n\nNotes\n\n1 A special meaning of the term ‘archival’ exists in writ-\nings about digital scholarly editions and counsels its use\nhere to mean what, in archival practice and theory,\nwould be termed a purposeful collection. (The term\n‘archive’ is strictly applied to a far wider, less struc-\ntured, and less completely described collection.) The\ntextual archive, as intended here, is typically organized\naround a literary work or works and consists mainly, or\nat least, of transcriptions and digital images of the rele-\nvant documents.\n\nEach period has produced its own textual complica-\ntions, but examples of these situations, drawn from\nthe Modernist period, include, respectively, Conrad\n(2013), Fitzgerald (1991), and Lawrence (1992).\n\nTara L. Andrews believes they will. She sees the digital\nedition as renovating the stemmatic and other study of\nmedieval and ancient works because of its capacity to\nincorporate and process the evidence (spelling, punctu-\nation}—which, traditionally for print editions, has been\npre-regularized to facilitate collation and to permit ana-\nlysis of the substantive variants in the documentary\nwitnesses (Andrews, 2013). Yet editors of modern lit-\nerature do not regularize spellings or ignore variant\npunctuation. They are routinely collated (if usually\nnot reported in full) because of their evidentiary\nvalue—an awareness that has not yet transferred back\nto the editing of earlier periods. So, for these editors at\nleast, the envisaged broadening of the evidence cannot\nbe the decisive change offered by the digital edition.\nSocial, Digital, Scholarly Editing Conference, University\nof Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada, July 2013. For\ntheir kind assistance or for their comments on this\nessay, I wish to thank Barbara Bordalejo, Roger\nHillman, Peter Robinson, Desmond Schmidt, Peter\nShillingsburg, Christina Spittel, and Marta Werner.\nFor a critique of the article by Siemens ef al. (2012), see\nRobinson (2016).\n\nSee the 2013 issue of Ecdotica (Vol. 10, pp. 7-93), for\nthe latest instalment in this old debate: essays by\nRobinson (2013), Gabler (2013), Eggert (2013),\nBordalejo (2013), and Shillingsburg (2013).\n\nFor a commentary on their difference in spirit and cul-\ntural expectation, see Eggert (2012).\n\nFor example, the title of Bowers’s article ‘Established\nTexts and Definitive Editions’ (Bowers, 1962) (‘defini-\ntive editions’ is used approvingly throughout, although\nargued to be not always feasible); ‘the new and newly\navailable definitive texts’: Gibson (1969) and, for\n“Gregian’ and ‘scientific’, Battestin (1981): ‘there is es-\nsentially one sound rationale for the treatment of copy-\ntext [that of W. W. Greg] ... The editor is concerned\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016\n\n9\n\n10\n\na\n\n13\n\n14\n\nwith establishing the ideal form of the text ... [exer-\ncising} a kind of rational control and discipline that it is\nnot too much to describe as scientific; and, like a sci-\nentist, the editor as he performs his task will be as ob-\njective and as unobtrusive as possible’ (pp. 3, 4).\nin einer Zeit eher wirkungsgeschichtlicher,\nliteraturpsychologischer\nOrientierungen gleichen die Lesartenlabyrinthe gigan-\ntischen FriedhGfen, in die sich nur wenige Besucher\nverirren’ [[It was] rather in a time when reception\ntheory, socio-historical and psychoanalytic criticism re-\ngarded the labyrinth of variants as huge cemeteries in\nwhich few visitors dared to wander}: Koopmann (1987,\np. 46).\nThe evidence in this paragraph derives from a four-\nteen-page typescript in the present author's posses-\nsion, dated June 1995, of a talk given to the D. H.\nLawrence Society (UK} by Michael Black, since pri-\nvately published in (Black, 2011), last chapter.\nFor a fuller account of the Lawrence Works edition see\n(Eggert, 2009b).\nDickinson (1955) was superseded by Dickinson\n(1998), Franklin, the editor of (1998), corrected\nmany errors, including the 1955 editor Johnson’s per-\npetuation of earlier editors’ running together of sep-\narate poems (eg, of poems 21 and 22 and 23 in\nDickinson (1998), 1. 79-81). But his principal innov-\nation was to edit each version separately. For the crit-\nical-editorial reception see Smith (1992); Werner\n(1995); and, for a general discussion, Erkkila (2002).\nThe initiator of the brou-ha-ha over Gabler’s Ulysses\n(Joyce, 1984} was Kidd (1988a, pp. 32-9 and his more\nconsidered ‘An Inquiry into Ulysses: The Corrected\nText’, 1988b). For Gabler’s reply see ‘What Ulysses\nRequires’ (Gabler, 1993). Mays’s edition was delayed\nby 10 years by a variety of factors at the Press and the\nfunding foundation, and by the death of the general\neditor Kathleen Coburn in 1991. See Mays (1992), and\nJerome McGann’s generous reception of Mays’s work\nin 2014 (McGann, 2014).\nShelley (2012) is over 1,100 pages. Another recent,\nutterly painstaking critical edition, the last in the\nCanadian series CEECT, demonstrates the increasing\nsophistication, even though it adopts a traditional\nGreg—Bowers copy-text approach and has a clear read-\ning text: Kirby (2012).

My two edi-\ntions in the series appeared in 1990 and 1994\n(Lawrence and Skinner, 1990, Lawrence, 1994). The\nfirst of them (The Boy in the Bush) was the first in\nthe Works series to appear in hardback only, which\nbecame the norm. Its print-run was 1,000 hardbacks;\nroyalty statements show that it remained in print for\n21 years. Its retail price began at £40; by 2011 when the\nlast copy sold, it was £106. The second title was\nTwilight in Italy and Other Essays in a run of 800,\nwhich took 9 years to sell out (initially at £55; by\n2003, £75). Continuing availability via digital reprints\n{since 2002) achieves a dribble of sales annually (total-\nling 114 and 145 copies respectively by 2012). The\nfinal volumes in the series over the past 10 years\nhave probably warranted print runs only in the mid\nhundreds, a figure that few full-scale scholarly editions\ntitles would likely be exceeding nowadays. Cf. Edward\nVanhoutte’s report ‘that the [German] historical-crit-\nical edition ... is a commercial disaster with sales fig-\nily dropping below the threshold of the 100\ncopies that are normally sold to libraries’ (Vanhoutte,\n2009, p. 104).\n\nThe Letters of D. H. Lawrence (Huxley, 1932): ‘Trivial\nnotes have not been reproduced. Nor, in most cases,\nbusiness letters. ... A certain number of passages that\n\n  \n\nures &\n\nmight have given pain to the person mentioned in\nthem, or that deal with personalities which it did\nnot seem right or decent to make public, have been\ncut out. Here and there, for obvious reasons, I have\nsuppressed a name’ (p. xxxiv). There is no policy given\nabout the more detailed editorial matters of presenta-\ntion; presumably Huxley left it up to his publisher.\nThe Collected Letters of D. H. Lawrence (Moore,\n1962), provides a ‘fuller representative collection’ (.\nxviii) of Lawrence’s letters but in the knowledge that a\ngreat many in existence were still unavailable. As a\ndefence of his policy of regularizing Lawrence’s pres-\nentations of wording, Moore quotes Robert\nHalsband’s article “Editing the Letters of Letter-\nWriters’ (1958): ‘When we decide to reproduce it {a\nhandwritten letter] by means of typography, we have\nmade a great concession; and once having made it we\nneed not be stingy as to its extent” (qtd p. xxii; p. 30 in\nthe original). Cf The Letters of D. H. Lawrence series\n(which appeared in 8 volumes between 1979 and\n2000): ‘The editors provide not a diplomatic tran-\nscription of Lawrence’s manuscripts but an edited\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\nThe reader-oriented scholarly edition\n\ntext which is accurate and reliable’ (Boulton, 1979,\nxviii), and the silent categories of emendation are\nfully listed (xvili-xx).\n\nThe Collected Letters of Joseph Conrad (Conrad, 1983—\n2007).\n\nArgued in Eggert (2005, 2009a).

The documentary\nform will typically be aimed at eliciting and presenting\nin some readable form the textual and other evidence\nof the single document understood as a historical act\nof writing; historical-critical, at recording the variant\nauthorized forms of the work via an apparatus refer-\nenced to a reading text of any one of them; the genetic,\nat teasing-out and then recording the steps by which a\ndraft text gradually came into being (or remained un-\nresolved); and the critical, at a reading text of the work\nor some version of it based on close comparison and\nanalysis of its extant and inferable forms, and with\ndecisions about the exact wording and forms of the\ntext made by appeal to one source of authority or\nanother. Emendation plays some role in the first two\nforms, little or no role in the third, and is formative in\nthe last.\n\nThe idea of editing as a form of argument has a his-\ntory. The ground had been laid by Peter\nShillingsburg’s distinguishing of competing editorial\norientations towards text in 1984 (Shillingsburg,\n1996}; and by the traditional understanding of the\nterm ‘critical editing’, which had implicitly acknowl-\nedged the necessity for interpretation of documentary\ninscriptions in the determination of final authorial\nintention. In 1994 Betty Bennett showed the inevit-\nability of interpretation also in the documentary edit-\ning of letters not intended for publication, where final\nintention was irrelevant: Bennett (1994). It is but a\nshort step from interpretation to its organization\nwithin argument, and thus to the slightly braver dec-\nlaration that editions are arguments. I first find myself\nsaying something like it in the late 1980s: ‘the edition\nis a mediation of the documentary texts ... the edition\nis not the work or even the part-work itself. Rather it\nis a new text established under argued criteria rigor-\nously applied: this is the basis of a critical edition’s\npower to persuade’: Eggert (1988, p. 152); then more\nexplicitly in a conference paper given at the University\n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n809\n\n//p/ LEfOHuB/yspAUOO dno olWeDBOBy:sdyy Woy DaDBOjUMOG)\n\nGi.\n\nSS SSTAPE\n\nZOZ Jequesec] go vO sasn Assign] Ausueaiuip euuaia Ag 9096:\n\n8\n\f"

I hadn't ever really intended to give it that much of my attention; but, as\nmy colleagues and I worked on the development of the digital scholarly network\nMediaCommons, it kept crowding in, as it has for many digital humanities projects:\nat every meeting, conference presentation, panel discussion, or other venue where\nwe discussed the kinds of work we were interested in publishing, one of the first\nquestions we were asked was what we intended to do about peer review.\n\nComing to the development of MediaCommons at one and the same time from\nthe position of being a scholar and that of being a blogger, I was of two distinct\nminds in responding to that question. The blogger in me wanted to wave the ques-\ntion off enormous amounts of influential intellectual work are being done on the\nInternet today without the benefit of prepublication peer review. The scholar in me\ngot it, however: influential as that intellectual work online may be, what is it worth\nwithin the academy’s systems of accounting? What kind of value can it have, unless\nbehind it stands some form of peer review, the gold standard of scholarly merit?\n\nIn thinking through that disjuncture in my responses, I came to understand\nthere to exist a profound mismatch between conventional peer review as it has been\npracticed since the mid-twentieth century and the structures of intellectual engage-\nment on the Internet.' This should not be terribly surprising; all our assumptions\nabout scholarly communication since the eighteenth century have been predicated\non the print technologies alongside and in conjunction with which they arose. These\ntechnologies operate under the conditions of certain kinds of material scarcity that,\nfar from being hindrances, in fact give them their authority. That same relationship\nbetween scarcity and authority was operative in manuscript culture; a text’s authen-\nticity derived from the trustworthiness of its source, the hand that produced it.

Within the scholarly universe, however, the\nvalue of a publisher’s imprimatur is not simply about that authorizing gesture but\nis instead directly tied to selectivity, to using the scarce resources of print in the wis-\nest possible way. The value of a journal’s name or a press’s imprint varies directly\nwith the perception that the texts it publishes are the “best”; perhaps perversely,\nthat sense of bestness derives in significant part from the number of texts that the\njournal or press rejects.\n\nThe disjuncture between this model and Internet-based publishing is imme-\ndiately obvious: while access to a publisher’s imprimatur is intentionally limited in\nprint, anyone with the right hardware, software, and network connection could sim-\nply publish anything online. This promiscuity is precisely what makes the open web\nsuspect for many academics, and the usual response of those who seek to defend\ndigital publication is to point to those online venues that employ traditional peer\nreview and are thus equally selective as many print publishers. The problem, how-\never, with this kind of online reproduction of the systems that govern print publish-\ning is that the Internet operates within a completely different set of technological\naffordances, which have in turn helped to foster a very different understanding of\nthe creation of authority. In contrast with print, the scarcities involved in Internet-\nbased publishing are not material; they are, rather, shortages of time and attention—\nshortages, in other words, that are experienced by those who are looking for infor-\nmation rather than by those who provide it.\n\nAs a result, over the course of the last twenty years, the publisher-derived\nimprimatur declaring selectivity has gradually become less important online than\nthe imprimatur that is conferred by community. Within the current structures of\nInternet-based communication, in other words, it is far less important to a given\nreader that some authorizing producer has declared a text to be of value—and even\nless important that this entity has done so by selecting this text from numerous other\nrejected possibilities—than it is that someone whom the reader knows, even if only\nby reputation, has read and recommended the text.

Fields such as the digital humanities, digital media\nstudies, and Internet research must take the lead in reconsidering their reliance on\nconventionally determined and awarded imprimatur and instead consider the ways\nthat field-based community models of authorization might more accurately reflect\nthe innovations taking place in the field. After all, the principle of exclusion on which\nconventional peer review relies for its authority is part of a cluster of well-established\ndisciplinary practices, practices that (in a most Foucauldian manner) not only cre-\nate a set of accepted procedures and methods through which scholars in a field do\ntheir work but also draw the borders of acceptability—of field, of method, of knowl-\nedge—as an exercise of power. The self-policing nature of peer review, coupled\nwith its reliance on the opinions of a very small number of usually well-established\nscholars, runs the risk of producing an ingrained conservatism, a risk-averse attitude\ntoward innovation, and a resistance to new or controversial approaches.*\nCrowdsourcing presents the potential to correct for the kind of conservatism\nthat exclusivity can foster. Just as many eyes make all bugs shallow, as the saying has\nit, so many readers might make the value of a piece of scholarship more apparent.\nTwenty readers, with twenty different perspectives, might be able to see what two to\nthree well-established readers cannot. Even more importantly, those twenty readers,\nif required not simply to respond to the work under review but to engage with one\nanother in the process, will push one another to deeper understandings not just of\nthe objects of their discussion but of the broader field with which their scholarship\nengages. In other words, crowdsourced review can improve on traditional review\npractices not just by adding more readers but by placing those readers into conver-\n\n \n\nsation with one another and with the author, deepening the relationship between\nthe text and its audience.\n\nItis important, on the one hand, to distinguish between the popular conception\nof crowdsourcing, with its sense that participation is open to “just anybody, and the\nkinds of crowdsourcing that can be accomplished within a preexisting community\nof practice, which Katherine Rowe has referred to as “our-crowd sourcing.’ Getting\nthe members of a scholarly field into open dialogue with one another around the\nevaluation of scholarship offers the possibility, as Rowe and I have explored else-\nwhere, of airing methodological or theoretical assumptions and biases rather than\nallowing them to remain covert points of contention within fields. On the other\nhand, new forms of networked communication have raised questions about the\nrelationship between expertise and credentials, suggesting that in many cases read-\ners from outside our narrowly defined fields, and even outside the academy, may\nbring much-needed perspectives to our work. It’s easy to see how open reviewing\ncan benefit interdisciplinary work by provoking discussion among scholars from\nmultiple disciplinary perspectives in the evaluation of a project. Beyond such obvi-\nous conversations across scholarly communities, however, many of us would ben-\nefit from discussions with readers located outside the academy.

The guiding principle for these\nfields, like that of the network technologies that facilitate them, should be open-\nness. The Internet operates as an end-to-end network, in which any packet of data\nis treated exactly like any other, leaving it to the endpoints of the network to dif-\nferentiate among data types, figuring out how each should be produced and used.*\nDigital fields should explore what such an end-to-end model might hold for them;\nif the communication network of the digital humanities were patterned after such\nan open principle and all scholarship were openly transmitted through it, might we\nfind a way to allow selectivity to be exercised at the network’s endpoint, with the\nconsumers of scholarship?\n\nThis is of course the “publish, then filter” model that Clay Shirky has argued is\nmost conducive to communication in a peer-based network, a mode of open com-\nmunication that not only relocates the point of selectivity from the publisher to the\nreader but that also suggests, as Chris Anderson has pointed out, that network-based\ncommunication presents scholars with a radical new understanding of the notion\nof the “peer.”’ This understanding shifted once at the birth of scholarly communi-\ncation, when the delegation of the royal imprimatur from the crown to early schol-\narly associations like the Royal Society of London began to press the dominant con-\nception of the “peer” from “peer of the realm” to “scholarly peer,’ a colleague whose\nstatus derived less from social privilege than from earned credentials.’ Today, that\nnotion is shifting again, as the meritocratic notion of the peer gives way in the age\nof the Internet to an understanding of a peer as any node connected to a network.\nWhile I hope to avoid being overly utopian in assessing the democratizing poten-\ntial of this shift, ] do want us to consider how this new notion of the peer might\naffect scholarly communication. What would happen if we were to recognize that all\nmembers of a scholarly community—all of the nodes on our particular disciplin-\nary or interdisciplinary network——have potentially valuable contributions to make\nto the development and evaluation of our work? What if we opened. that network\neven further, to all interested readers inside and outside our fields, inside and out-\nside the academy? What kinds of community-based filtering would such recogni-\ntion make possible?\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, we also need to ask how we can get such commu-\nnal processes of evaluation to count as evaluation in the academic sense. As aca-\ndemic processes of credentialing have become increasingly tied to the imprimatur\ngranted by publisher selectivity, it has become, in turn, increasingly difficult to imag-\nine suitable alternatives.

Scholars working in\ndigital fields are already subject to personnel-based processes (hiring, tenure, pro-\nmotion) overseen and conducted by faculty and administrators who often do not\nsee the value of the new forms of scholarship that they are producing. The impri-\nmatur granted by traditional peer review has often been an important recourse for\nthose scholars whose work is controversial or defies traditional form. And yet, if\nthat mode of peer review doesn’t provide digital scholarship with the most suitable\nform of evaluation, the digital humanities must take control in developing a system\nof evaluation that does suit our needs.\n\nMoreover, I would argue that we must develop means of articulating, clearly\nand. compellingly, the value of open peer review—both the importance of these\nprocesses for the free and open exchange among peers and the kinds of data that\nsuch processes can provide as a means of evaluating the reception of the scholarship\nunder consideration. As I have recently suggested elsewhere, tenure and promotion\ncommittees must find ways to understand the forms of assessment that take place\naround and in digital scholarship, but those of us engaging in that digital scholar-\nship must help make our modes of assessment comprehensible to those commit-\ntees, to articulate to them how the forms of review that take place at the network’s\nendpoints function and how their results might be interpreted.’\n\nIn imagining ways that scholars in the digital humanities might support the\nrobust evaluation of their work in open formats, we will need to consider a num-\nber of somewhat different cases: there are differences between the requirements for\nreview of traditional textual scholarship published in digital environments, such as\nthat in open access journals and online monograph series, as opposed to the review\nof work that does not take the form of textual argumentation, such as archival proj-\nects or multimodal work, or the review, post hoc, of DIY-published online mate-\nrial such as scholarly blogs. The latter two cases obviously cry out for new modes\nof open review, as they concern work that is nearly always published, in the sense\nof having been made public, without being subjected to prepublication peer review\nand very often without the benefit of a publisher’s imprimatur. But in all three of\nthese cases, institutional acceptance of the publications for credentialing purposes\nwill require making visible what John Guillory has referred to as the immanent\nscene of judgment—laying bare for future evaluators the mechanisms by which this\nmaterial has been judged by experts within the field—and finding ways to translate\nthat immanent judgment into information that can be comprehended at the sites\nof review that move further and further outside the field (the department, the col-\nlege, the university).\n\nOpen review online provides a number of mechanisms through which this\nimmanent scene of review can be examined; we already have the capacity to gather\na lot of data about how digital publications are received and responded to, includ-\ning things like the number of page views, of visitors, and of inbound links.

The alternative-\nness of careers in digital humanities has in fact been a subject of long debate and\nmuch concern; many early researchers in what was then termed. “humanities com-\nputing” were located. in liminal and academically precarious institutional spaces\nsuch as newly created instructional technology support units and grant-funded\nresearch groups. Much energy was devoted—then as now-—to discussion of how\nand whether this domain could become a discipline, with its own faculty positions\nand academic legitimation. And although those faculty positions and degree pro-\ngrams are starting to appear, many jobs in what is now called “digital humanities”\nare still para-academic, though their funding and institutional position has been\nconsolidated somewhat. What has received less discussion, interestingly, is the word\n“career” itself. Its origins in horse racing (“the ground on which a race is run, a race-\ncourse ...a short gallop at full speed”) are long past but not irrelevant: the word\narticulates a sense both of boundaries for a specific type of effort and of the intensity\nand directedness of the effort itself. In professional terms, a career has both direc-\ntion and impetus; it is inescapably competitive.\n\nThe phrase “alternate careers” is thus remarkable at second glance not for sug-\ngesting that there are alternatives but for the centrality it still accords to those aca-\ndemic careers that are not alternate. This centrality is not just an effect of graduate\nstudy and not only perceptible within the academy; it shapes the way universities are\nunderstood as workplaces even by those who stand outside them. So, for instance,\nwhen I mentioned to the person who was fixing my truck that I worked at Brown\nUniversity, without giving further detail, he assumed that I was a professor there.\n(If he was being deliberately flattering, the point is surely the same.)

Thus on the basis of pure statistics (and even allowing for my apparent level of\neducation and socioeconomic positioning), I am much more likely to be anything\nut a faculty member. The professoriate, though, provides the characteristic para-\ndigm through which we understand the nature and function of the university: an\ninstitution composed of professional faculty whose job is to teach students and to\nerform research.\n\nThis idealized view stands in for the real complexity of the university as an insti-\ntutional ecology of work—in which every hour of faculty work is brought into being\ny hundreds of hours of time spent maintaining the physical and administrative\nspace within which that work is conducted: libraries, network, payroll, buildings,\nand all the rest of it. But it also stands in for, and obscures, the real complexity of even\nthe “purely academic work” that goes on within the university. The sketchy wire-\nrame figure of the professor suggests a division of labor and a level of intellectual\nindependence that, in the emerging age of digital scholarship, is increasingly obso-\nete. It also suggests a strongly defined intellectual and professional career trajectory\nthat, as Alan Liu astutely observes in The Laws of Cool, may no longer be character-\nistic of modern knowledge work: “to be a professional-managerial-technical worker\nnow is to stake one’s authority on an even more precarious knowledge that has to\ne re-earned with every new technological change.”\n\nTo fill in these complexities is to gain a clearer understanding of how other\ninds of academic jobs stand in relation to that of the tenured faculty and also to\n\n \n\nsee how those relationships have been structured in the academic imaginary. These\n“alternative” or “para-~academic” jobs within the academy have a great deal to teach\nus about how academic labor is quantified, about different models of work and\nwork product, and about the ways that aptitude, skill, expertise, and productivity\nare weighed in assessing different kinds of work.\n\nSituating the discussion within the domain of digital humanities puts these\nissues into more specific focus. It brings into view a wider range of work practices\nand. roles: the novel job descriptions that arise out of digital humanities project\nwork but also the novel forms of academic practice that even conventional aca-\ndemics find themselves undertaking when they embark on a digital project. But it\nalso sharpens our attention to the question of what “knowledge work” really is and\nwhere its boundaries lie. The tension within the domain of digital humanities work\nbetween the practical and the theoretical, the technical and the scholarly, recapitu-\nlates a familiar dialectic within the traditional academy but does so in a way that\nprods us toward a new synthesis. If we understand “knowledge work” as a material\npractice, we may come closer to demystifying it.\n\nIn what follows Iam going to set out some case studies based on my own work\nexperience and try to unpack their significance and what they can reveal about dif-\nferent kinds of academic work.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:15 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 293\n\f"

Again, it may be useful to take a deliberately naive look\nat this job to understand how it was conceptualized. The WWP at that time was\nan independent unit reporting to the dean of the faculty, and its funding was\nderived partly from grants and partly from the university. It had originated in\nthe English Department, and its agenda was still largely set by its faculty advi-\nsors, but its grant funding was awarded in large part because of its exploration\nof the use of digital technology, and the project was thus recognizable (to con-\ntemporary observers) as a hybrid: a project with a literary research agenda, using\ntechnology as a tool in furthering scholarly goals. The project was codirected\nby Susanne Woods (a full professor of English) and Allen Renear (a member of\nthe staff in Computing and Information Services but holding a PhD in Philoso-\nphy). Its other professional staff included a programmer and the managing editor\nposition that I held. Despite its traditional title, this job had an unusual profile,\nresulting from the experimental way in which these books were being produced:\nby converting the WWP’s SGML files into a format that could be read by Frame-\nMaker, which we then used to produce camera-ready copy following the press’s\nspecifications. My sole qualifications for the job were a familiarity with the con-\ntent of the books and the management of the series (as a result of earlier proof-\nreading work) and a willingness to learn anything else required by the job: page\nlayout, FrameMaker, book production processes, the principles of textual editing,\nand enough about SGML to work with the project’s programmer to troubleshoot\nthe conversion mechanism.\n\nTt is worth noting that this job, like many jobs at the time in what was not yet\nbeing called “digital humanities,’ had no discernable career trajectory. The project’s\ndirectors had other “real” jobs (as faculty, as permanent staff in the IT organiza-\ntion), and the project’s programmer could, by gaining further experience and skills,\nadvance to other more senior programming jobs; but the managing editor position\n(for a graduate student who was still in principle planning to become a faculty mem-\nber at some point) did not look like part of a track of professional advancement, at\nleast not within the academy. The job skills cohered only in the context of the work\nof the WWP, but even there they did not represent either a permanent niche or a\ndevelopmental stage toward one. The job was in effect an emergency response to a\nsudden and temporary need.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:15 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\n| 295\n\f"

All\nof us became used to thinking of ourselves as consultants: people who might work\non many different projects during the course of the year as called upon. One did\nnot necessarily identify strongly with any single project, but one became adept at\nprojecting oneself imaginatively into the space of each project, in turn, mastering\nits particular constraints and terminology so as to be able to act (program, design,\nresearch, encode, etc.) appropriately within the project context. This provisional\nidentification with multiple projects gave us all a peculiar facility for seeing projects\nata kind of metalevel: understanding their commonalities as projects and observing\nthe types of problems and design challenges that emerged repeatedly. We gained. a\nsimilar understanding of the disciplinary language and motivations that inhabited\nsuch projects: again, not as a matter of personal identification as a scholar in a cer-\ntain field but rather as someone who is able to observe disciplines from a perspec-\ntive slightly to one side.\n\nSalary IT\n\nAta certain point, STG was reorganized to eliminate its reliance on outside funding\nand reduce its level of financial risk, and at this point the WWP was moved outside\nof STG and established as a separate unit, also within CIS but funded entirely on soft\nmoney. My job during this period was thus that of a typical salaried staff member,\nexcept that all the funding for myself and my WWP colleagues had to be raised either\nthrough grants or through licensing income from Women Writers Online (which by\nthis time was starting to generate significant revenue). The result of this multiplicity\nof funding sources, however, was to reproduce in many ways the fiscal psychology\nof our time as consultants, in the sense that we remained very much aware of how\nour time was being spent and funded. In a year when the WWP had a grant from\nthe National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), part of our time would be\nallocated to the work for that grant (and paid from the grant ledger) while the rest\nwould be allocated to WWP activities (and paid from license income). From time\nto time, when a shortfall in grant funding left us with a deficit, some staff time was\n“bought” by STG for specific projects.\n\nMost recently, the WWP and STG have both been moved into the university\nlibrary as part of its Center for Digital Scholarship. Although this move has not\nchanged the WWP’s fiscal arrangements, it has meant a subtle shift in how our work\nis construed in relation to the scholarly mission of the university.

Perhaps most importantly, the idea that we conduct\nresearch seems natural and in keeping with the library’s larger mission.\n\nFreelance\n\nRunning in parallel to this entire narrative is another with an entirely different\ndevelopmental trajectory. Since 2000, my partner and I have had a small consulting\nbusiness through which we have worked on an eclectic range of projects, ranging\nfrom simple database development to digital publication to grant writing. Like my\nteaching activities at the University of Tlinois discussed later, this is for me a strictly\nevenings and weekends and vacation activity (though for my partner it is his job).\nAlmost all our projects have some connection with digital tools, formats, or activi-\nties,* but it is not our purely digital expertise that is most important in these projects\nbut rather our digital humanities expertise: in the sense that our literacy in a range\nof humanities disciplines and our skills in writing, strategic planning, and informa-\ntion design are essential in making our digital expertise useful to our clients. The\nsuccess of the consultancy, in other words, arises directly out of (and has as its neces-\nsary precondition) an engagement with academic practices, standards, and subject\ndomains. In an early interaction, one client said that what she found valuable about\nour intervention was that it mediated usefully between purely technical informa-\ntion on the one hand (which did not address her conceptual questions) and purely\nphilosophical information on the other (which failed. to address the practicalities\nof typesetting and work flow). We enabled her to understand how the decisions she\nwas making about information modeling would affect both the intellectual content\nof the electronic publication and the realities of getting it produced.\n\nLike all knowledge work that identifies itself as a species of “consulting,” what\nwe are doing in this role is situating ourselves as apart from—and even to a certain\nextent “above”—the knowledge domains of our clients. Just as critical theory came\nin the 1980s to occupy a position of metanarrative with respect to the traditional\nacademic disciplines, so consultancy positions itself as a kind of metaknowledge, an\nexpertise concerning the ways in which knowledge work is conducted. It’s useful in\nthe context of this essay to understand the value of this type of work—and indeed\nhave been arguing in favor of it throughout—but it is also important to put some\ncritical pressure on the terms of its self-valuation.\n\nThe value of this kind of consulting work—for both the consultant and the cli-\nent—is the self-consciousness it provides concerning the nature of the work being\ndone and the terms on which it is conducted. A typical situation for a consultant\nis to be asked for help addressing what is taken to be a small practical problem. In\nthe process of learning the context for addressing this problem, the consultant and\nclient discover that in fact the practical problem arises from a deeper set of issues\nthat had not been fully analyzed. or understood, because the client was too close to\nthem (or lacked the perspective) to see them.

The con-\nsultant must identify, however briefly and professionally, with the client’s situation\nin order to provide useful advice while retaining enough distance to provide advice\nthat goes beyond what the client would come up with on his or her own. Even as\nwe treat self-consciousness as an outcome of this work, though, it may turn out to\nbe more importantly a precondition of it, in the sense that people with this turn of\nmind (or training) will tend to approach their work in this spirit and may gravitate\ntoward consulting roles no matter what their actual jobs.\n\nWith these points in mind, it is interesting to observe that digital humanities,\nas an institutional phenomenon, has evolved very substantially out of groups that\nwere originally positioned as “service” units and staffed by people with advanced\ndegrees in the humanities: in other words, people with substantial subject expertise\nwho had gravitated. toward a consulting role and found it congenial and intellec-\ntually inspiring. The research arising out of this domain, at its most rigorous and\nmost characteristic, is on questions of method. Indeed, digital humanities has taken\nand been given responsibility for reforming the humanities disciplines, in virtue of\nthe fact that it requires an attention precisely to method. By formalizing humani-\nties research practices and rendering explicit the premises on which they rest, digi-\ntal humanists also make possible critique and change.\n\nMy own professional preparation for working as a consultant, as this narrative\nhas already shown, was in fact my acculturation as a para-academic: my various jobs\nin publishing, editing, supporting, teaching, grant writing, and studying. What inter-\nests me most about this work, though, has to do with the ways that various kinds\nof knowledge—technical, scholarly, practical—are valued. 1 suggest that there are at\nleast two forms of valuable knowledge in play. The first is the knowledge that the\nclient values because they are glad they don’t have it (or have responsibility for it):\nthey value it in the consultant because it represents what they think they are buying.\nTechnical knowledge falls into this category: in my case, knowledge of XML, data-\nbases, electronic publication systems, digital project management. The second, more\nproblematic category is the knowledge that makes the first type usable to the client—\nnamely, the metaknowledge through which the consultant grasps the client’s subject\narea.

Precisely because of its potential value (if I were\nbeing considered as a colleague), it must be explicitly devalued here to show that I\nam not so considered: it creates a necessity for gestures of demarcation by which the\nboundaries of my role can be drawn, with technical knowledge on the inside and\nsubject knowledge on the outside.*\n\nPdlike to describe one project in particular that may be illuminating in this con-\ntext, namely the work that my partnership has been doing on the Modern Language\nAssociation’s (MLA) New Variorum Shakespeare (NVS) Editions, starting in 2003.\nOur work has been focused on developing specifications for representing these edi-\ntions in TEI and XML and for accomplishing the encoding of the three most recent\neditions, plus associated other tasks. As already suggested, our technical expertise (in\nthis case, familiarity with markup languages and XML publishing) had an obvious\nrelevance and importance, but arguably more important was the ability to under-\nstand and explain the editorial significance of technical decisions and to serve as\na bridge between the two strands of the project: the project’s editorial work (con-\nducted by senior humanities faculty) and the project’s technical implementation\n(overseen by professional staff at the MLA who manage the production of the edi-\ntions in print and digital form but for whom the XML is largely unfamiliar terrain).\n\nFor this project, we began by examining the intellectual specifications for the\nedition, which were described in the editorial guidelines: these prescribed (most\nsignificantly) the organization of readings from the textual witnesses that are col-\nlated for each edition, the organization and presentation of the commentary in\nwhich the editor summarizes the history of criticism on each line of the play, and\nthe arrangement and representation of the play text. From this information we were\nable to create an information model of the edition: essentially, an understanding of\nwhat the informationally significant components of the edition are and how they\nare functionally related to one another. For example, each textual note (represent-\ning the set of variant readings on a given word) must contain both a reference back\nto the line containing the word in question and a formally organized arrangement\nof readings; each reading in turn contains the textual variant and a reference to\nthe witness(es) where that variant is attested. We then formalized this information\nmodel in a TEI schema, through which these informational nodes and relationships\ncould be expressed and constrained.* Finally, we wrote comprehensive documenta-\ntion of the encoding practices required to produce a TEI version of an NVS edition\nand tested the entire system through the process of encoding three successive edi-\ntions and creating working output of various types.\n\nThis development process, effecting as it did a complete translation of editorial\nmethodology from one medium into another, also produced an interesting shift of\nperspective. In a classic edition project—such as the NVS notably was when it was a\nprint-only edition—there are many kinds of knowledge in operation, including the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:15 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

In this uni-\nverse the editorial knowledge that produces the work is understood to operate at\nthe highest level: it directs and motivates the others and carries a kind of cultural\nauthority as knowledge work in relation to their instrumentality. At the start of our\nwork on the NVS, this relationship between types of knowledge was also in opera-\ntion with respect to the digital implementation of the project: the XML encoding\nof the text was being treated as part of a typesetting process and was being executed\nin that spirit, as a way of producing a manifestation or set of items rather than as a\nprocess with implications higher up in FRBR’s great chain of being. The discourse\naround the use of XML was substantially instrumental: it concerned the practicali-\nties of supporting a digital interface and generating PDF output and similar issues.\n\nTreating this work as information modeling, however, has produced a subtle\nshift in these relationships. Most significantly, it has repositioned the TEI/XML: no\nlonger solely as part of a production workflow aimed at producing output but rather\nas the formal (and authoritative) instantiation of the knowledge that constitutes the\nedition, as the information model for the edition itself Where in the print produc-\ntion process the editorial manuscript was taken as the most informationally rich\nartifact in the ecology (whose contents would be translated into an effective print\ncarrier for those ideas), in the digital process the editorial manuscript is a precur-\nsor to that state: the XML encoding brings information structures that are latent\nor implicit in the manuscript into formal visibility. Once completed, the XML data\ncarries in itself the information needed to generate all the possible manifestations\nof the edition: in print, in PDF, in interactive forms, in visualizations derived from\nthe data, in Braille, and so forth. The knowledge that in this work process is posi-\ntioned as “technical,” in other words, actually turns out to be the metaknowledge\nthrough which the original motives of the NVS editions can be projected into a dif-\nferent medium with different representational properties.\n\nFaculty\n\nThe final dimension to this complicated. professional identity is in many ways the\nmost conventional: a turn to university teaching.

For them, the know1-\nedge associated with digital technologies is both instrumental (a job skill that can\nimmediately be applied in very practical ways) and foundational (a set of concepts\nand. technologies that intersect with and enrich other dimensions of library and\ninformation science). For many of them, their working lives within the academy\nwill be very much like mine, though probably less peripatetic; as librarians their\nwork will be positioned at the intersection of three different paradigms of knowl-\nedge: subject expertise, “practical” or “technical” skills, and a kind of metaknowl-\nedge that inheres in their mastery of information science (e., the organization and\nmanagement of knowledge across and apart from specific subject areas).

At the same time, from another perspective their differences\nare most salient: for the typical humanities faculty member, most of these paradigms\nof work are equally alien; only the first will look truly familiar (the adjunct faculty\nposition is familiar but not to be identified with). Examining these two cases for their\ncommonalities, we can suggest that what characterizes mainstream academic work\nis two qualities. The first is the unlimitedness of the responsibility: work interpen-\netrates life, and we do what is necessary. For instance, we attend conferences with-\nout there being a question of whether it’s our “own” time or our employer’s time;\nthere is no concept of “vacation” during the academic year and very little functional\nconception of “business hours” except as a personal heuristic device. The second,\nrelated characteristic is the way time is conceptualized as a function of work practice.\nTime for academics is not regulated in detail, only in blocks. (For nine months you\nare paid; for three months you are free to do other things; at all times you should\nbe working on your next book.)\n\nMost digital humanities work, however—as performed by library staff, IT staff,\nand other para-academic staff who are not faculty—is conceptualized according to\none of the other models: hourly, by FTE, or as an agenda of projects that granu-\nlarizes and regulates the work in quantifiable ways. Increasingly, the use of project\nmanagement tools to facilitate oversight and coordination of work within IT orga-\nnizations has also opened up the opportunity to track time, and this has fostered\nan organizational culture in which detailed managerial knowledge of time spent\non specific tasks and on overhead is considered virtuous and even essential. As\nwe have seen, in an organization like the early STG, such tracking was a structural\nrequirement for billing; but, even in organizations where the idea of “billing” time\nto a project is simply an enabling metaphor, the use of time management as a way\nof understanding work processes and achieving greater efficiency and productivity\nis clearly immensely appealing.\n\nThese terms of value—efficiency, productivity—are not inapplicable to tradi-\ntional academic models of work, but their applicability is considered strictly volun-\ntary, qualitative, and relative. We can gauge the importance of voluntariness here by\nobserving the shock and disgust with which attempts to increase productivity (e.g.,\nby increasing class size or stipulating specific levels of scholarly output) by external\nenforcement are greeted: academic work is considered to have the privilege of self-\nregulation, being in this respect more like the work of a poet than of a journalist.\nThe importance of qualitative rather than quantitative measures of work is similarly\na kind of class marker: the cases in which specific metrics are typically applied (e.g.\nnumber of students and courses taught, quantity of committee work) are those that\nare least felt to be characteristically scholarly work. Quantifying scholarly output can\nonly be done at the crudest level (¢.g., number of books or articles published), and\nthe relative and comparative nature of these assessments quickly becomes apparent:\na monumental, groundbreaking book is worth much more (but how much more?)\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:15 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

In my own experience working in\nan IT organization (with time regulated by the hour or the project), the tension\nbetween quantitative and qualitative measures of productivity was a constant source\nof methodological self-consciousness. Within the most local organizational context\n(the Scholarly Technology Group, whose name sums up the conundrum), this ten-\nsion was understood to be an interesting problem rather than a practical difficulty:\nwe knew ourselves to be doing cutting-edge research at the same time as we were\nproducing useful projects, and at a metalevel we were fascinated by the interplay of\nthese two undertakings. However, the parent organization (the more unequivocally\nnamed Computing and Information Services department) understood our work to\nbe much simpler to define and measure: we were supporting faculty projects, and\ncompleting those projects successfully was a desirable and quantifiable outcome.”\nAs a historical matter, it is also worth noting the evolution of these practices and\nexpectations: members of CIS from its earliest days remembered a time when the\norganization was much more research oriented, developing experimental software\ntools and providing much more improvisational and. open-ended forms of sup-\nport. The transformation into a modern IT organization involved the importation\nof work and management practices that were explicitly derived from the corporate\nrather than the academic world.\n\nWhat are the larger effects of accounting for time and regulating it in these\nways? One important effect is that time and work appear fungible and intercon-\nvertible. The calculus of time and effort by which we know the cost and value of an\nhour of an employee’s time is also the basis for assessing how those resources could\nbe used otherwise. On the spreadsheet that tracks the project, that unit of funding\n(time, product) could be spent to purchase an equivalent quantum of time or prod-\nuct from some other source: from a vendor, from an undergraduate, from a con-\nsultant, from an automated process running on an expensive piece of equipment.\nThe precise quantification of time and effort permits (and motivates) a more direct\ncomparison of work according to metrics of productivity and speed and permits a\nmanagerial consciousness to become aware of all the different ways of accomplish-\ning the same task with available resources.\n\nThis last formulation—accomplishing the same task with available resources—\nreverses the narrative of academic work that is on view at liberal arts colleges and\nresearch universities, in which a thoughtful person pursues his or her original ideas\nand is rewarded for completing and communicating them. In this narrative, the\ndefining and motivating force is the individual mind, with its unique profile of sub-\nject knowledge and animating research vision. The managerial consciousness turns\nthis narrative on its head by suggesting that in fact the task and available resources\nare the forces that most significantly define our work and that the choice of person\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:15 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

In that\ncase, would these para-academic jobs lose their distinctive structural role in the\necology, their ability to foreground method? Or, from another angle, does the inev-\nitable naturalization of these jobs as a routine career (rather than an odd alterna-\ntive to a mainstream narrative) reduce the incumbents sensitivity precisely to issues\nof method, discourse, and professional identity?

As fond as Lam of\ngoats, what this idea really represents for me is a reminder that ultimately what we\ndo is work and that there’s useful work to be done wherever we look. Those of us\nwho work in the academy and the para-academy are lucky to have jobs that are (for\nthe most part) steady, physically harmless, flexible, full of cultural value, and oppor-\ntunities to learn. If our jobs also give us a sense of identity, that is both a bonus and\na pitfall: a source of inspiration and also an opportunity to confuse our own worth\nwith what the job seems to confer on us. This is a risk to which the academy seems\npeculiarly prone: witness the fact that for most PhD candidates the idea of accepting\na job other than a tenure-track faculty position is tantamount to an admission of\nfailure. The reason why Mr. Silva assumed that I was Professor Flanders—the reason\nthat no alternative is visible to him-——is that no alternative can be articulated by the\nprofession itself. And yet the vast preponderance of actual work involved in creating\nhumanities scholarship and scholarly resources is not done by faculty. As we already\nnoted, for every hour of scholarly research in an office or library, countless other\nhours are spent building and maintaining the vast research apparatus of books,\ndatabases, libraries, servers, networks, cataloguing and. metadata standards, the-\nsauri, and systems of access. If the academic mission, in its broadest sense, is worth\ndoing, all parts of it are worth doing.

In the archetypal digital humanities collaboration, tradi-\ntional faculty explore forms of work that would ordinarily look “technical” or even\nmenial (such as text encoding, metadata creation, or transcription); programmers\ncontribute to editorial decisions; and students coauthor papers with senior scholars\nina kind of Bakhtinian carnival of overturned professional usages. Examples of this\nare real and yet also imaginary, in the sense that they are not taken as actual mod-\nels to be generalized but as exceptional cases that we can celebrate without imitat-\ning. Nonetheless, in my own experience these interactions have had. very specific,\nbeneficial effects on all participants that are worth generalizing if we can. For fac-\nulty, involvement in other kinds of work provides a perspective that cuts across the\ngrain of standard academic work practices, and it gives a vivid and well-grounded\nunderstanding of how scholarly ideas are instantiated in digital research projects.\nFor technical staff, these collaborative relationships produce a much richer intel-\nlectual context for their work and also convey a sense of the complexity of human-\nities data and research problems, which in turn makes for better, more thoughtful\ntechnical work. For students, the opportunity to work on real-world projects with\nprofessional collaborators gives unparalleled exposure to real intellectual problems,\njob demands, and professional skills across a wide range of roles, which in turn may\nyield a more fully realized sense of the landscape of academic work.\n\nWith these benefits in mind, there are a few things that we can do to encourage\nthese interactions and to develop a professional academic ecology that is less type-\ncast, that obscures less thoroughly the diversity of working roles that contribute to\nthe production of scholarship (digital or not):\n\n1. Make it practically possible and professionally rewarding (or, at the very\nleast, not damaging) for graduate students to hold jobs while pursuing\nadvanced degrees. This would involve rethinking our sense of the timing of\ngraduate study and its completion: instead of rushing students through\ncoursework, exams, and dissertations only to launch them into a holding\n\npattern (potentially for several years) as postdocs, finished but still enrolled\n\n \n\nstudents, or visiting assistant lecturers, graduate programs would need to\nallow a bit more time for the completion of the degree and ensure that\nstudents graduate with some diversity of skills and work experience.\n\n2.

They rarely collaborate with other centers, with whom they com-\npete for funding and prestige, and when working in isolation they are unable to\naddress the larger problems of the field. Especially on campuses where there is an\nexisting “traditional” humanities center, digital humanities centers even run the\nrisk of being silos on their own campuses if they don’t work actively at collabora-\ntion. Tensions on campus can also exist when a center that aspires to be treated as\na research unit is treated by administrators as a service unit instead, and the per-\nceived divisions between “research” centers and “service” centers, in turn, create pro-\nfessional hierarchies that can inhibit the formation of potentially fruitful collabo-\nrations among centers. Centers also siphon off grant funding from schools unable\nto afford a digital humanities center of their own and thus can make it harder for\nscholars at such places to participate in the larger projects. Are they crucial to the\nfuture of the field, or deleterious to it? Or to point the question more finely, in what\nways and under what circumstances might digital humanities centers be seen as\nmore crucial to the field than deleterious? What exactly is the function of the digi-\ntal humanities center at the present time?\n\nThe potential value of digital humanities centers to individual scholars and to\nthe field as a whole is stated poignantly by Mark Sample in a blog entry “On the\nDeath of the Digital Humanities Center.” In elegiac tones, Sample mourns, at first,\nproleptically for centers that will have come and gone and for centers that never will\nbe but then also for all those in the field who are laboring now without the support\nof a digital humanities center:\n\nMost of us working in the digital humanities will never have the opportunity to\ncollaborate with a dedicated center or institute. We'll never have the chance to\nwork with programmers who speak the language of the humanities as well as Perl,\nPython, or PHP. We'll never be able to turn to colleagues who routinely navigate\ngrant applications and budget deadlines, who are paid to know about the latest\ndigital tools and trends—but who'd know about them and share their knowl-\nedge even if they weren’t paid a dime. We'll never have an institutional advocate\non campus who can speak with a single voice to administrators, to students, to\ndonors, to publishers, to communities about the value of the digital humanities.\n\nWhile Sample is concerned. in this post about how digital humanities can further\nitself as a field without being dependent on centers, he recognizes that centers pro-\nvide significant benefits to those beyond a particular center’s own campus, and\nhe himself teaches at George Mason University, home to one of the most highly\nregarded digital humanities centers in the world.\n\nAs Sample also recognizes, “there is no single model for the digital humanities\ncenter.

To our left is the office of MITH’s busi-\nness manager, Chris Grogan, who has been completing the paperwork for the sec-\nond phase of OAC, or the Open Annotation Collaboration,> whose purpose is to\n\n \n\ncreate an interoperable web annotation environment that enables the sharing of\nannotations across the boundaries of annotation clients, annotation servers, and\ncontent collections. The founding partners of this Mellon-funded project include\nthe University of Hlinois and George Mason’s Rosenzweig Center for History and\nNew Media.\n\nDirectly in front of us, at the end of our tour, is MITH’s seminar room, which\nhouses the Deena Larsen Collection,’ a rich archive of early-era personal comput-\ners and software for researchers from within or beyond the campus interested. in\nearly hypertext and electronic literature and for MITH’s own in-house research in\ndigital curation and preservation. In the seminar room, we also teach classes, hold\nmeetings and. consultations, and host on Tuesday afternoons Digital Dialogues, a\ntalk or presentation featuring either an invited guest to the campus or a member of\nour local research community. Since 2005, MITH has hosted over eighty of these\nDigital Dialogues, featuring many of the most prominent names in the field and\nattended by people throughout the greater Washington, D.C., area. For those who\ncan't attend in person, we release each Digital Dialogue as a podcast.\n\n \n\nRetracing our steps, toward the door, we pass my office, in front of which I bid\nyou farewell in order to join the faculty members from our dance, kinesiology, and\ncomputer science departments who are working with MITH on a project for the\ndigital documentation and preservation of dance, in partnership with the Kennedy\nCenter, the New York Public Library, Lincoln Center, and the Advanced Comput-\ning Center for the Arts and Design at Ohio State University.\n\nThis tableaux did not take shape overnight. MITH was made possible twelve\nyears ago by a major Challenge Grant from NEH under the joint auspices of the\nUniversity of Maryland’s College of Arts and Humanities, Libraries, and Office of\nInformation Technology. It began with a director and two graduate research assis-\ntants and over the years has grown to ten faculty and full-time personnel as well as\nabout a dozen full- or part-time staff members supported through grant funding,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:11 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 285\n\f"

In the past year alone, MITH has hosted workshops on computer\nforensics for born-digital materials, advanced Text Encoding Initiative (TED) man-\nuscript encoding, alternative digital humanities academic careers, and the building\nof Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). MITH is also developing certificate\nprograms and degrees in digital humanities. In partnership with the Computer\nScience Department and the iSchool, it has recently initiated Digital Cultures and\nCreativity, an innovative curriculum and learning community for first- and second-\nyear students that combines art, imagination, and global citizenship with new media\nand new technologies. We conceive of MITH as an applied think tank, a place where\ntheory and practice meet on a daily and a broadly interdisciplinary basis. Located\nin McKeldin Library at the heart of the campus, MITH serves as a campus-wide\nhub and regional destination for those interested in the digital humanities and new\nmedia.\n\nThis extended sketch of MITH is meant to convey as concretely as possible\nthe diverse kinds of research and the complex blend of faculty, staff, students, dis-\nciplines, partnerships, audiences, and funding streams that revolve around a major\ndigital humanities center. As MITH helps to illustrate, digital humanities cen-\nters have a great capacity for focusing, maximizing, and networking local knowl-\nedge, local resources, and local communities of practice for benefits that extend far\nbeyond the immediate campus community. There is a limit to what any one center\ncan accomplish on its own, however, which is way MITH helped to launch center-\nNet, an international network of digital humanities centers.’\n\nThe Local Center and the Global Network\n\nIn the preface to A Survey of Digital Humanities Centers in the United States, a\nreport published by the Council of Library and Information Resources, Amy Fried-\nlander appreciates that many digital humanities centers have “incubated important\nresearch, fostered a generation of humanities scholars who are comfortable with\nthe technology, devised creative modes of governance, assembled diverse portfo-\nlios of funding strategies, and built significant digital collections and suites of tools”\n(Zorich, vi~vii). But she warns that since most centers are “focused on their home\ninstitutions, they are at risk of becoming silos” and that such “institutional parochi-\nalism can inhibit the building of shared resources, like repositories, or of services,\nlike long-term preservation, that represent a shared infrastructure where the impact\nof the shared resource is enhanced precisely because multiple parties contribute to\nand use it?(vii). In the main body of the report, Diane Zorich similarly claims that\n“the independent nature of existing centers does not effectively leverage resources\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:11 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

The competition among centers for prestige\nand relatively scarce funding resources exacerbates this problem, as does the diffi-\nculty of working across national boundaries, cultural divides, and language commu-\nnities. These centripetal forces are powerful; and, to the extent that they are not over-\ncome, they drastically limit the significance of the work done by individual centers.\n\nIt was precisely to address these pressing issues, to network the local with the\nglobal, and to establish individual digital humanities centers as key nodes of inter-\nnational cyberinfrastructure that centerNet was born at an American summit meet-\ning of digital humanities centers and funders in April 2007 cohosted by the NEH\nand MITH. The American term “cyberinfrastructure,’ much like the European term\n“e-science,” can be defined as the linking together of computing systems, data stor-\nage systems, tools and data repositories, visualization and virtual research environ-\nments, people, and communities of practice by software, shared standards, and high\nperformance networks in order “to improve research productivity and enable break-\nthroughs not otherwise possible” (Stewart). The importance of digital humanities\ncenters “as crucial seedbeds of innovation” and key nodes of American cyberinfra-\nstructure was stressed in Our Cultural Commonwealth, a report on cyberinfra-\nstructure for the humanities and social sciences, commissioned by the American\nCouncil of Learned Societies and released in 2006, which served as the immediate\ncatalyst of the summit meeting.\n\nCurrently consisting of some 250 members from over 140 digital humanities\ncenters in twenty countries, centerNet has four regional steering committees: in\nAsia Pacific, Europe, North America, and the UK and Ireland. Its initiatives include\nthe following:\n\n* Promoting regional meetings, workshops, and conferences for the purposes of\nintellectual exchange, solidifying community, and the professional develop-\nment of staff and graduate students\n\n* Connecting centers around the world along the lines of their methodological\naffinities for sharing expertise and collaborative project development\n\n* Nurturing a new generation of hybrid scholars, working in staff positions that\ncombine service and research components\n\n* Developing collaboratively new curricular models\n\n* Legitimating the field and the value of digital humanities centers, especially in\n\ncountries where digital hunianities is only just emerging\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:11 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 287\n\f"

Over a hundred\nyears ago, the current disciplinary structure of the humanities assumed its present\nshape, and though the world has changed much since then humanities disciplines\nhave not.’ New programs in such areas as gender studies, race studies, and cultural\nstudies, among others, have often been relegated to the province of the humanities\ncenters that started to appear in significant numbers in the second half of the twen-\ntieth century, precisely in order to accommodate what the traditional humanities\ndepartments could not in the form of interdisciplinary or cross-disciplinary studies.\n\nMore recently, digital humanities centers have sprung up to accommodate the\nchallenges to the traditional humanities posed by new media and technologies and\nthe particular forms of knowledge and cross-disciplinarity they entail.° Humanities\ncenters of both kinds have thus been historically positioned to dream the future of\nthe university, so to speak, to take the lead in scholarly innovation and disciplinary\ntransformation. Their ultimate function at the present time is not just to help set\nthe agenda for the new humanities to come but to work in practical ways to help\nbring this transformation about. Crucial to realizing this goal is centerNet’s five-year\nformal affiliation with the CHCI, through which both organizations have agreed to\nwork together to build scholarly and technical capacity in the field of digital human-\nities by way of shared grant projects, shared training, and shared events, beginning\nwith a joint conference at the University of Toronto in June 2011.\n\nThe digital humanities center as an institution can enable such large transfor-\nmations to start close to home. As Amy Friedlander notes,\n\nIn an environment where scholars identify with their disciplines rather than with\ntheir departments, and where significant professional affiliations or communi-\nties of interest may transcend the boundaries of scholars’ colleges and universi-\nties, centers offer interdisciplinary “third places”—a term sociologist Ray Olden-\n\nburg has used to identify a social space, distinct from home and workplace.

Familiar examples\nare barbershops, beauty salons, and coffee shops where, in the age of wireless, we\n\nsee tables of students hunched over laptops, textbooks, and notepads. (Zorich, vi)\n\nFor Friedlander, within the kind of “third place” typified by digital humanities cen-\nters, “technology is simultaneously a driver and an opportunity, and. the centers,\nwhether virtual or physical, effectively become safe places, hospitable to innovation\nand experimentation, as well as anchors from which to base the intellectual analog\nof civil society in which third places are vital parts” (Zorich, vi). Such “safe places”\nare crucial not only because all the cyberinfrastructure in the world won't amount\nto much if scholars within the humanities disciplines aren’t using it but also because\nthey mitigate the risks posed by the kind of interdisciplinary teamwork that A Digi-\ntal Humanities Manifesto correctly identifies as the “new model for the production\nand reproduction of humanistic knowledge” (para. 10).\n\nThe ultimate function of the digital humanities center at the present time, then,\nis to be an agent of change. As Steve Ramsay has observed in his blog posting “Cen-\nters of Attention,” “We like to marvel at the technological wonders that proceed from\nthings like servers, but in this case—I would say, in all cases—the miracle of ‘com-\nputers in the humanities’ is the way it forced even a highly balkanized academy into\nnew kinds of social formations. Anyone involved with any of these big centers will\ntell you that they are rare sites of genuine collaboration and intellectual synergy—\nthat they explode disciplinary boundaries and even the cherished hierarchies of aca-\ndemic rank.” Ramsay also notes that the capacity of individual centers to produce\nsuch transformations is dependent on the degree to which its university adminis-\ntrators treat them as research units, valuing them “not because of the services they\nprovide, but because of the culture they represent—a culture that has always been\nabout the two things we value most: the advancement of knowledge and the edu-\ncation of students.” Even the longstanding division in which a humanities faculty\nposition is primarily equated with research while a staff position is equated with\nservice is being altered in digital humanities centers, which are increasingly being\nstaffed by a new kind of hybrid scholar with advanced degrees in the humanities\nand their own research agendas.\"\n\nA Digital Humanities Manifesto is right to claim that “Interdisciplinarity/\ntransdisciplinarity/multidisciplinarity are empty words unless they imply changes\nin language, practice, method, and output” (para. 5). These kinds of changes are\nsocial, cultural, and even economic as much as they are technological. But they\nare also profoundly international in their effect and potential effectiveness and\nmight therefore be called. the “cosmopolitics” of the digital humanities, to adapt\nKant’s term for the “universal community” that cuts across all national borders.\nTo the extent that digital humanities centers can work together despite the formi-\ndable forces that keep them apart, they can engage at this cosmopolitical level.

For Benjamin,\nthis “corruption of the press” was so widespread as to necessarily inform any “his-\ntory of information” (28). But Benjamin’s insight can also apply by corrupting the\nvery word “corrupt” to mean something like “error” As bibliographers and textual\ncritics well know, it is hardly possible to write the history of information without\nattention to errors, accidents, variants, and changes—the dynamics of corruption\nand correction that pattern the history of published print. As this essay will argue,\nit is also hardly possible to write the future history of information—an enterprise\nin which the essays in this volume are very much involved—separately from those\nsame dynamics as they manifest, in new ways as well as old, in online and digital\npublishing. But we have yet to do so.\n\nAs Steven Berlin Johnson argues, “[t)he history of knowledge conventionally\nfocuses on breakthrough ideas and conceptual leaps. But the blind spots on the map,\nthe dark continents of error and prejudice, carry their own mystery as well. ... These\nquestions, too, deserve their own discipline—the sociology of error” (Ghost Map,\n15). This essay undertakes such questions for the current moment in electronic\npublishing by looking to the history of printing errors and the labor of correction.\nThat history offers valuable perspectives on the proliferating effects of “accidentals”\nand error within the automation, syndication, and algorithmic relations of the web.\nIt further informs how scholarly publishing’s digital futures might (or might not)\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:07 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 259\n\f"

The\nhistory of error also opens some theoretical perspectives (sometimes noted as lack-\ning in digital humanities discussions), suggesting that, even if we do not dedicate\ntechnology or labor to these issues, the digital humanities needs to reckon conceptu-\nally with what, in a different context, John Unsworth called “the importance of fail-\nure.” Scholarly publishing will inevitably change, but before its print-based model\ntotters into the grave we need clearer commitments about the error proofing it has\ntraditionally undertaken as well as the consequences of reinventing or abandoning\nsuch functions altogether as we move to new formats.'\n\nCertainly, the discussions about the digital transformation of publishing,\nespecially (though not exclusively) the publishing of critical work and scholarly\nresources, have mapped an array of important issues whose problems and opportu-\nnities need to be resolved, including peer review, credentialing, collaboration, intel-\nlectual property, multimodal textuality, encoding standards, access, and sustainabil-\nity? But largely absent from these discussions, or playing only a minor role, is the\nfate or future of copyediting, fact checking, the often thankless tasks of verification\nand correction that usually happen behind the publishing scenes. This omission\nis at once entirely consistent with the historical instability of copyediting (as I will\nsuggest) and uniquely problematic from a contemporary perspective. While “Jhon\nMilton” is an easy enough error to catch (nonetheless his e-book Areopagitica is cur-\nrently for sale on Amazon [Trettien]), the typographical, factual, and citation errors\nthat characterize any publishing endeavor, online or in print, will not be resolved by\ncasual or professional use in the ways commentators have envisioned.’ Electronic\nerrata have potentially cascading effects that we would do well to consider in imag-\nining futures for digital publishing and networked scholarly communication.’ So,\nalso, do new regimes of correction have limitations and theoretical compromises\nthat we should not ignore.\n\nBefore situating this argument historically, | want to make two major caveats\nabout the present moment. Discussions of online publishing and digital projects\nhave in fact deeply considered the problems of “error” in terms of preservation and\ntheir own technical obsolescence, including everything from hardware to browser\ninteroperability to the degradation of links or “link rot.” Second, there has been\nabundant attention to the errors of digitization, OCR, and metadata cataloguing,\nexemplified in Geoffrey Nunberg’s ongoing critique of the Google Books initia-\ntive and projects like MIT’s “culturomics” initiative that depend on the integrity of\nGoogle’s data. Furthermore, any programmer worth her silicon knows the simple\nequation of “garbage in, garbage out” (GIGO), which underwrites the integrity of\ndata and. code. My argument is not that we are ignoring error but rather that we\nhave not sufficiently considered error correction as a structural feature and theo-\nretical premise within the transition to digital publishing.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:07 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

In\nfact, ignoring the particulars or correction ironically threatens to replicate a con-\nservative notion of textuality that digital publishing was supposed to displace. Nor\nis this just scholarly nitpicking. If publishing errors seem mundane or even triv-\nial compared to the greater transformations in digital scholarship, they have the\npotential for aggregate effects on the network and discourse we are producing. It\nmay be that we decide that such errata do not warrant much technical concern or\nthat they should fall down the scale of scholarly values as recalibrated by digital or\nopen publishing. But these positions need to be articulated; we need clearer plans\nfor the obsolescence of academic correction.

On the otherwise mostly pleasant trajec-\ntory of, say, submitting a finished article, having it acknowledged or accepted, mak-\ning further substantive revisions, and then sending it off for publication, the copy-\nedited proofs one receives can come as a bit of a shock.

Indeed, they had to be kept intact\nfor PMC to leverage its more revolutionary proposal of open digital publishing.\n\nWith all due respect, this was a boring and tedious job. The workflow requires\na different kind of attention than reading the articles or reviewing their arguments.\nInstead, the assistant confirms the page number, bibliographical citation, and tex-\ntual accuracy of every piece of quoted, referenced, or footnoted material in a given\nmanuscript. The assistant scurries all over the stacks in the library, hoarding arm-\nloads of books to check a mere fragment in any one of them. The assistant becomes\nthe scourge of the interlibrary loan department, winging out endless requests for\ncopies of materials the library does not have. From today’s vantage point, the assis-\ntant seems like the motor arm in a Rube Goldberg reinvention of a database, scram-\nbling the physical world for the items that a digitized network would so easily trace.\nDatabases and electronic versions of sources might resolve some of these logisti-\ncal difficulties, but they invite other obstacles, including access policies, the integ-\nrity of digitized materials, and coverage. Then and now, the editorial assistant has\nto undertake a serious amount of mundane labor. I am very grateful someone did\nthat for me, whoever you are.\n\nSuch an assistant or fact-checking process is not necessarily a part of every\nscholarly publishing venture. But the assistant embodies a particular attitude toward\ncorrection whose institutional evolution is worth considering. Though the messy\ndetails of book history may seem remote from the digital transformation of pub-\nlishing, they set the conceptual terms and labor conditions that have reached a cru-\ncial moment of redefinition. The anonymity and transient labor of the journal fact-\nchecker or copyeditor is itself a historical legacy of the publishing business at large.\nProofreading has a history as long as writing itself, but, in print publishing, the fig-\nure of a specialized in-house proofreader only emerges in the seventeenth century\nin continental Europe, subsequently adopted in the mid-eighteenth century by Eng-\nlish printers. This was the “corrector”: typically only employed by larger publishing\nhouses, correctors were “not as a rule trained printers, but were men of education\nspecially employed, sometimes on a part-time basis” (Gaskell, 172). Then, as now,\nthe corrector occupied an ambiguous middie ground between editorial and pro-\nduction, between the managerial and technical realms. In Philip Gaskell’s hierarchy\nof labor of the English book trade to 1800, the corrector falls right on the thresh-\nold between business owners, printing masters, and overseers (all with fixed wages)\nand the journeymen, apprentices, and juvenile ranners who worked for them (all\npaid piecemeal) (171-74). Though expected. to be well educated and to exert edito-\nrial influence on the copy, they were not in the salaried echelon of a house’s edito-\nrial or commercial management. Though paid piecemeal, working with in-process\nsheets and collaborating with the compositors and printers assembling them, they\nwere not allied to the working press.

Having\nalways occupied. a tenuous middle ground between management and production,\neditorial positions of various kinds have been subject to significant cuts.’ From a\ndifferent perspective, emerging enthusiasm about unfiltered publishing online has\nprivileged speed, accessibility, and distribution over the comparatively tedious labor\nof editorial nitpicking. In effect, the corrector’s function has been dismissed or else-\nwhere absorbed. by publishers and independent content producers across the con-\ntinuum of scholarly publishing. But the consequences for its seeming disappearance\nor reinvention are significant.\n\nRevaluing Review and Correction\n\nAs with the death of the author, the disappearance of the corrector raises the specter\nof what might be called, after Foucault, the corrector function: a relation of value\nbetween a printed text and its typographical, factual, and stylistic integrity. The his-\ntorical quirks and ambiguous status of the corrector underscore how such a func-\ntion is constantly being negotiated through the economic, social, and technologi-\ncal conditions of the present, or within the discourse of publishing. According to\na variety of observers, that discourse is experiencing a paradigmatic shift with the\nadvent of digital publishing in various commercial, civilian, and scholarly forms.\nSo, too, are its structuring relations and values in flux.\n\n \n\nvery much including cor-\nrection and the notion of a published or finished text. Looking at the genealogy of\nthe corrector, we can still find its functions in the present (such as with copyeditors,\ngraduate editorial assistants, etc.), but what are its futures? Will the prepublication\nfunction of correction continue to make sense? Or how will it evolve?\n\nFor scholarly publishers and university presses, digital publishing has heralded\na major transformation in their businesses. But attention to correction, in either\nits traditional or its future incarnations, seems notably absent from some of the\nmore conspicuous forums in which university presses have worried or speculated\nabout their futures.’ While the industry is quick to celebrate its role in “improv-\ning work through peer review/editing,” the particular values or necessities of cor-\nrection go relatively unmentioned (Brown et al., 36). Peter Dougherty suggests in\nhis “Checklist for Scholarly Publishers” in transitioning to the digital future that\n“lel ditorially, our work is cut out for us”; however, attention to the editorial integrity\nof copy remains implicit at best.

Taken together, these forecasts skew toward the managerial and\ntechnical domains, toward modified business models and digital production strate-\ngies. Obviously, scholarly publishers have some serious and pressing concerns, but\nthe declining attention to correction starts with publishers themselves.\n\nFrom a different perspective, the inattention to correction seems symptom-\natic of changing attitudes about its necessity. In an important blog post titled “The\nSocial Contract of Scholarly Publishing,” Dan Cohen recounts a conversation with\nhis mentor and collaborator Roy Rosenzweig about a book manuscript they had\nrecently finished. In an unguarded moment, Cohen asks, “So, what now?” Isn’t the\nbook for all intents and purposes finished? Couldn't it be published online imme-\ndiately? “Isn't it 95% done? What's the last five percent for?” Rosenzweig’s response\nsketches out what Cohen calls “the magic of the last stage of scholarly production\nbetween the final draft and the published book.” It amounts to the mystification of\nthe scholarly fetish. As Rosenzweig replies, “What happens now is the creation of\nthe social contract between the authors and the readers. We agree to spend consid-\nerable time ridding the manuscript of minor errors, and the press spends additional\ntime on other corrections and layout, and readers respond to these signals—a lack\nof typos, nicely formatted. footnotes, a bibliography, specialized fonts, and a high-\nquality physical presentation——by agreeing to give the book a serious read.” With a\nquick jerk, Rosenzweig pulls the curtain of this social contract, exposing the hoary,\nwizard-like scholar as a fabrication in smoke. The “magic” of scholarly prestige is\nproduced by the business of publishing. By contrast, click an “Update” button in\nWordPress and poof! It’s gone—and with it, all the social, disciplinary, or institu-\ntional credibility of our faith in the 5 percent. Cohen wants to change this equation,\nas do a host of scholars imagining (and actively realizing) the possibilities of near-\ninstantaneous, inexpensive, networked scholarly communication on the web. In a\nfollow-up post titled “Open Access Publishing and Scholarly Values,” Cohen com-\npletes the arc of the argument: the social contracts of peer-reviewed print scholar-\n\n \n\nship are rapidly expiring, and digitally open-access scholarship is driving the refor-\nmulation of scholarly values at large. Forget the 5 percent. The “added value” of the\ntraditional scholarly publishing model no longer adds up.\n\nIn these posts, Cohen does not address what futures might be afforded to the\ncorrector function. Perhaps there are none. It is certainly possible to think about\ncopyediting and fact checking as tactical elements in the cost-recovery model of\nclosed or for-profit publishing. In other words, such correctness is not scholarly\nintegrity ipso facto but as much a by-product of the historical development of\npublishing as the material features of the book, notions of authorship, and peer\nreview. Corrected and copyedited texts are saleable and signify in a reputational\neconomy because they have been processed in ways that users are unlikely to repli-\ncate or undertake themselves.

With Hacking the Academy, they crowdsourced a book\nin one week, inviting contributions from anyone in a range of forms and media.\nCohen and Scheinfeldt collected many of them for an open-access volume pub-\nlished by University of Michigan’s digitalculturebooks series. Scheinfeldt reports\nthat he and Cohen are responsible for all the copyediting, which is still labori-\nous but out of necessity less than is usually undertaken for academic volumes. As\nScheinfeldt speculates, this situation will likely become the norm: in addition to\nmore speed, “less nitpicking overall, more work thrown back on the editor/author,\nand more responsibility on the reader to read texts critically for factual and other\nerrors.” If, by 1900, texts declared themselves correct on arrival at a publisher, we\nmay soon see correction become a postpublication process, if it happens at all. The\nfirst shift eliminated the reading boy and changed the dominant mode of correc-\ntion from aural to ocular. The current shift may eliminate the editorial nitpicker\n\n \n\nentirely, displacing correction onto the reader or to autocorrecting functions of\nnetworks.\n\nScheinfeldt is sanguine about the economics of this situation, including its\nuncompensated outsourcing of work, but he is also optimistic about its potentials.\nWhy belabor the 5 percent when a new model of publishing repays it twice over\nwith intellectual and social dividends? Shana Kimball—editor of the Journal of Elec-\ntronic Publishingas well as head of publishing services, outreach and strategic devel-\nopment at the University of Michigan’s Scholarly Publishing Office—thoughtfully\nasks, “|mlight scholars decide that speed, agility, and network effects of open, web-\nbased forms of scholarly communication trump perfection and error-correction\nin some cases?

Like scholarly publishers themselves, Fitz-\npatrick’s attention is drawn elsewhere—again, justifiably so but in ways that are also\nsuggestive of how debates about digital publishing and peer review are largely tak-\ning place on different terrain.\n\nThese debates have instead concentrated on new forms of review including\nin-process open review, peer-to-peer review, postpublication review, no review at\nall, or automated/synthetic review as an effect of usage and search engine ranking\nalgorithms. Planned Obsolescence was itself subject to both traditional peer review\nthrough New York University (NYU) Press and open review on the web, as the draft\nwas published online with CommentPress, allowing for open user comments by\npage and paragraph. To Fitzpatrick’s great credit, she posted both of her official read-\ner’s reports (by Lisa Spiro, with permission) along with exposing her prepublication\nmanuscript to public scrutiny and commentary. Examining these documents and\ntheir assembled commentary reveals a genuine intellectual generosity in each mode,\nand. Fitzpatrick acknowledges the contributions of each in improving the manu-\nscript. So, too, does each mode offer the occasional correction or copyeditorial note\non typos and style, but only sporadically. Fitzpatrick reports that the open review\ndid offer a fair bit of such suggestions but that commenters primarily engaged with\nthe argument—which is exactly what she wanted (“Re: open review”). The revised\nmanuscript was itself sent out for professional copyediting by NYU Press.\n\nThis method of open review is seeing more trials elsewhere. The journal Shake-\nspeare Quarterly (SQ) has undertaken several rounds of preprint open review on\nthe web. The comments during its initial experiment, like those for Planned Obso-\nlescence, favor an engagement with the argument rather than pointing out errors.\nThe “FAQ” for the second trial advises potential reviewers that “the most useful\nfeedback is that which an author can use to strengthen an argument,” though short\ncomments are fine. According to associate editor Sarah Werner, SQ is neither expect-\ning nor relying on open review to provide stylistic, citational, and factual correction.\nIt happens in places but is still conducted after the review trial is over: “each article\nis fact-checked by either the Managing Editor or the Production Editor, and the\narticle is copy-edited by the Managing Editor and the Editor.” Werner suggests that\n“both of those are things that even the best, most careful writers have a hard time\ndoing for their own work.” Furthermore, “fact-checking provides reassurance that\nthe argument the author is making is reliable and gives the necessary tools for other\nscholars to do their own assessment with the sources.” Just as PMC kept its familiar\neditorial foundations upon which to innovate, SQ remains a fairly traditional aca-\ndemic journal, committed to the added intellectual values of editorial work.

In an e-mail, Fitzpatrick\nwrites “that this kind of editorial work still remains important” but expresses hope\nthat “a fair bit of it might usefully be crowdsourced” (“Re: open review”). Cohen\nagrees that “some of it could be crowdsourced, but there is something to having one\nor two people really work hard on polishing a text” (“Re: open review”). It is hard\nwork, and not everyone is volunteering for it. Fitzpatrick is extremely aware of the\nsustainability challenges of crowdsourced labor and indeed has done much to focus\ndiscussions of open review and digital publishing on this important concern. Stevan\nHarnad, a pioneer of open review in the sciences, explains the strains upon its sus-\ntainability this way: “The expert population in any given speciality [sic] is a scarce\nresource, already overharvested by classical peer review, so one wonders who would\nhave the time or inclination to add journeyman commentary services to this load\non their own initiative, particularly once it is no longer a rare novelty, and the entire\nraw, unpoliced literature is routinely appearing in this form first.” Not least for this\nreason, Harnad concludes that “open peer commentary [is] an extremely powerful\nand important supplement to peer review, but certainly no substitute for it (origi-\nnal emphasis). While Harnad does not specifically engage questions of correction\neither, his argument can make sense of correction’s labor by analogy: open correc-\ntion might supplement, but not substitute, for its disciplined undertaking. Indeed,\nthe particular aspects of correction’s labor may make it more difficult to sustain or\ncrowdsource than peer review. While a commenter might be compelled to offer their\ntime and expertise “to strengthen an argument” (“FAQ”), are they likely to under-\ntake the tedious nonreading aspects of factual accuracy and citation checking?? Or,\nas Silvia Hunter points out, to have the professional background to protect authors\nfrom legal issues like copyright infringement or libel? Are you, dear reader, check-\ning the accuracy of all my quotes and references as you go? Or, conversely, are you\nprepared to relinquish them to the voluntary or automated curation of the open\nweb or to their own scholarly obsolescence?\n\nNew Schemes for Correction\n\nVarious scenarios are already in play for the implementation, reinvention, or dis-\nmissal of the duties of formal scholarly publishing as it migrates to digital and online\nforms. For example, the platform for Open Journal Systems (OJS) comes with built-\nin roles for a wide range of editorial functions for users to customize. Its workflow\nreplicates the traditional structures of peer-reviewed scholarly publishing, distin-\nguishing between editorial guidance, peer review, and copyediting by the sequential\ntransactions of electronic documents (Willinsky et al.)

The “Bentham-\nometer” registers the project’s progress as a whole while individual users accumu-\nlate “points” in competition with one another. The online Bite-Size Edits Project,\nspawned by the blog Book Oven, also uses a points scheme to entice its users to\nrecommend improvements to snippets of creative writing. Users can cash in their\naccumulated points for selected books. Dickens Journalism Online is conducting\na closed trial of distributed proofreading among academics, appealing to their\ninterest in the material to generate a high-quality online resource. Project Guten-\nberg’s distributed proofreaders project was based on a similar concept of engaged\nvolunteerism (Hart).\n\nOther models look past user interactions to experiment with automating the\nlabor of correction. In reviewing current approaches to digital preservation, Fitz-\npatrick considers the LOCKSS model (Lots of Copies Keeps Stuff Safe) pioneered\nby Stanford University Libraries. In this model, digital materials from participating\nlibraries in various forms, editions, versions, and formats are aggregated across “an\nopen source, peer-to-peer, decentralized digital preservation infrastructure” (“What\nis the LOCKSS program?”). Fitzpatrick explains that, “as the project’s name suggests,\nthe redundancy of its distributed files creates a safety net for the material” (Planned\nObsolescence, 40). But while LOCKSS is a distributed system, it also exerts its own\ncentral bibliographic control: a LOCKSS Box crawls for content, which it then com-\npares to similar content on the network of other libraries’ LOCKSS boxes, automati-\ncally repairing differences or damage. These automatic corrections result from peer-\nto-peer “opinion polls’——-an automated relational system that synchronizes content\nbased on the predominance of certain copies (Maniatis et al.). The LOCKSS system\npreserves the integrity of content on the level of bits and bytes and also automati-\ncally migrates content formats to stave off obsolescence. While LOCKSS primarily\ndeals with things already published, the CLOCKSS (Controlled LOCKSS) initiative\narchives “all journal content to which publishers allow access, both presentation\nfiles and source files” (Planned Obsolescence, 40). CLOCKSS adds to the complex\nrelations of postpublished versions of files some of the various states of their evolu-\ntion. In each case, as Fitzpatrick suggests, “the network is self-correcting” (Planned\nObsolescence, 40).\n\nCorrection is not the only strategy to deal with error: search and recommen-\ndation engines like Google and Reference Extract are practicing error avoidance.\nIn other words, these engines source the opinions and usage events of a com-\nmunity to derive some measure of credibility in returning and ranking results.\nThese kinds of systems have already been compared to automated peer review\n(O'Malley, “Googling”), though they are more complex in accumulating data\nabout the entire network. They do not just build in recommendations but map the\npatterns of what data are accessed by whom and why.

The\nrelational integrity of such data on and within the web is key, and facilitating the\nrelation and interchange of data has been among the primary goals of the “semantic\nweb.” The challenges are formidable, including (in the definition of the P2P Founda-\ntion) “resolving or mediating potential heterogeneities” from the proliferating and\n“discrete categories of potential mismatches.” Even beyond the problem of “seman-\ntic mediation” or resolving “what does the data mean (its semantics),” Mike Berg-\nman suggests that we still face “crucial challenges in . . . reasoning over that data\n(inference and pragmatics), and whether the data is authoritative or can be trusted.\nThese are the daunting—and largely remaining challenges—of the Semantic Web.”\nAt the risk of oversimplifying the technical specificities and complexities of this\nundertaking, I would suggest that these goals can be usefully related to the correc-\ntor function: resolving mismatches, clarifying semantic relations, and authorizing\ntrust in a textual media and its relational economy of ideas. If that analogy holds,\nthen correction has a future that is vital to the evolution of the web.\n\nAlmost everyone concerned with digital publishing acknowledges that it must\nmean more than finding an electronic equivalence with print. The future of schol-\narly publishing gets right to the heart of the semantic web. In a talk titled “The\nGlass Box and the Commonplace Book, Steven Johnson outlined what he considers\ntwo paths for the future of text: text in “glass boxes” (closed, nonreactive forms for\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:07 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 271\n\f"

We can easily relate these metaphors to scholarly publishing, though Johnson\nis more broadly interested in the systemic intelligence of the web itself. He proposes\na notion of “textual productivity” for how the web semantically processes and net-\nworks texts through its cascading algorithms, completely beyond the scope of any\ngiven writer or designer. Publishing in open forms facilitates these effects. Johnson\nargues that, “by creating fluid networks of words, by creating those digital-age com-\nmonplaces, we increase the textual productivity of the system. ... [This] may be\nthe single most important fact about the Web’s growth over the past fifteen years.”\n\nFor many scholars, this argument only underscores why scholarly publishing\nshould open itself to the serendipitous productivity of the semantic web. But the\nrelative inattention to correction in new publishing models may impede the very\ntextual productivity by which the semantic web works. Because networked scholarly\ncommunication will increasingly operate through structured metadata and auto-\nmated relational processes, it is imperative to consider the particular hindrances\nof errors within this scheme. In this sense, correction works more as “semantic\ndebugging” for the scholarly network. Because new models of scholarly publishing\nare making fewer affordances for correctors, we ought to imagine the outlooks for\na historical function upon which the technical promises of the future may signifi-\ncantly depend.\n\nConsider again the entirely commonplace errors of misquoting or incorrectly\nciting sources in a research article.’ In my copyedited manuscript, 1 was stunned\nthat someone tracked through databases and far-flung print sources to confirm the\nreferential integrity of my text, the accuracy of quoted materials. Had that not hap-\npened, those errors have the potential to proliferate through a “textual productivity”\nall their own.\" Perhaps open review would have caught them, but I doubt it. Perhaps\nthey would be discovered and altered through usage in a “continuous” or “dynamic”\npublishing model, but there is low traffic on the long tail of academic inquiry.* Pur-\nthermore, many research sources (especially those containing historical objects) are\nthemselves relatively untrafficked or only available offline. It could be argued that\nthese citations could be compared to electronic surrogates of their sources or simi-\nlar citations or quotes published elsewhere, generating a “correct” version through\nredundancy——the principle underwriting LOCKSS as well as search engine page\nranking. Of course, the power of redundancy works both ways, as errors or contested\nrepresentations can themselves proliferate enough to take the spotlight.'*\n\nIt may become increasingly important for citations to be proofread rigorously.\nIn the sciences at least, open publication is earning practitioners and institutional\ncapital through an architecture of recognition: “(t]he most important driver for this\nchange is the availability of highly accurate bibliographic and citation databases”\n(Hindawi, 100). Accuracy here is key, and it depends on relations that databases\nformalize, which in turn depend on cataloguing, description, and citational integ-\nrity, which themselves depend on the contingencies of input. Citations are prone to\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:07 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

For example, Jéran Beel and Bela Gipp\nhave researched how academic content can be optimized for search engines as well\nas how it can exploit their relational architecture. In the first case, they emphasize\nthe importance of good metadata and consistency in citations, names, special char-\nacters, and so on, which can otherwise hurt rankings (Beel, Gipp, and Eilde, 184).\nIn the second, they used a “fake book,” “fake articles,” “fake authors,” and “nonsen-\nsical text” to successfully manipulate the information and rankings in online direc-\ntories (Beel and Gipp). The automated network of citations, whether generated by\nacademic-themed search engines, portals, and archives or else constituted by the\nassociative functions of the open web at large, will significantly be shaped by the\nproliferation of data in accurate or perverse forms.\n\nThe interoperability of conventional citation styles (e.g., MLA, APA, Chicago,\netc.) presents another challenge, as the included data can vary between them.\nAmong the potential solutions is to describe the data capaciously enough to encom-\npass the differences of styles and unique usages or to assign universal references\nto cited documents. But the universality of online referencing has problems all its\nown considering the tenuousness of electronic linkage. As Fitzpatrick argues, “[o]\nur digital publications thus must employ a system of bibliographic identification\nthat allows object identifiers to resolve dynamically into the correct URL as mate-\nrials move” (Planned Obsolescence, 38). She notes the increasing popularity of the\nHandle System and digital object identifiers (DOD), which can be integrated with\n“resolvers” to access local pathways and resources for users in any variety of cir-\ncumstances. Universal identifiers and automated resolution are the twin arms in\na new system of bibliographic control. Errors or contingencies can be accommo-\ndated. on the fly.\n\nWe are seeing “self-correcting networks” that improve as their data expand,\nincluding distributed or automated textual correction, networks of citation and\nresource access, and digital object storage systems like LOCKSS. But automation has\nissues. As even the casual user of word processing software knows, the auto-correct\nfunction should give us pause. Auto-correction is as liable to produce errors in “nor-\nmalizing” data as it is in correcting them. This may particularly apply to cases, such\nas in some humanities research, where the objects or lexicons are often well out-\nside the norm or the horizons of digital access. Of course, with the pace of digitiza-\ntion, that situation will change. It is possible to imagine artificial intelligence agents\nas the next generation of auto-complete software, able to deal with acute semantic\npuzzles and the remotest bits of brainy trivia. Automation would certainly answer\nsome of the labor challenges of correction.” It is also possible to imagine, instead of\nan agent, automated correction as an emergent property of the information com-\nmons as a whole.\n\nOr it is possible to imagine that, once displaced into automated environments,\nwe will simply stop caring.

Hunter\nworries about “the possibility of a total breakdown in scholarly communication’ (7).\nThese anxieties can be forgiven of a professional community that has seen its for-\ntunes decline. Such academic apocalypse is unlikely: there will be minor breakdowns\nalong the new routes of networked scholarly communication, and from these we\nare learning how to renegotiate the editorial and corrector functions for the digital\nfuture. In doing so, we need to consider not merely the problems of error but the\neditorial theory that the digital futures of publishing articulate or come to embody\nwhether by intention, emergence, or neglect.\n\nIn Radiant Textuality, Jerome McGann considers the implications of social\ntext theory for cultural objects on the web. McGann argues that texts in any media\nare n-dimensional, but the web exposes textual radiance in strikingly evident and\noften unpredictable ways. The arc of McGann’s thinking can be traced back to his\nintervention in A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism, wherein he challenged a\nprevailing theory of copytext and the practice of editorial idealism. They had com-\nbined to produce textual editions that synthesized various sources and relied upon\neditorial judgments of authorial intention or best possible variants. But because\nthe web is unbound, online editions can manifest all the witnesses and variants\navailable to digitization. The Rossetti Archive was designed to test exactly this, and\nits editorial procedures required multiple and redundant levels of proofreading by\nits employees.’* The results are, in the language of the archive, “trusted objects”>—\nwherein “trust” describes scholarly integrity for users as well as interoperability\nwith the tools being concurrently developed by the Networked Infrastructure for\nNineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship (NINES), including collation, annota-\ntion, and exhibition software. The archive’s bibliographic control is not antithetical\nto radiance but instead helps to expose its textual manifestations.\n\nThe trouble with dynamic curation, textual redundancy engines like LOCKSS,\nand any self-correcting network is that they threaten to resuscitate an editorial ide-\nalism on the web. Furthermore, the automation of correction can displace edito-\nrial judgments into the synthetic functions of server polling or algorithms whose\nlogic may be increasingly difficult to extract or kept private by commercial entities.\nInstead of a network of radiant texts, these functions may produce a “copyweb” of\nidealized content. From another angle, the editorial forgiveness of errors for the sake\nof scholarship’s “true quality” also risks the problematic interventions of twentieth-\ncentury bibliography. As Philip Gaskell declared, “[I]et us carry out the author's\nintentions whenever we can, but not to the extent of taking pride in reproducing\nthe manifest inadequacies of his accidentals” (359). But for the web and its seman-\ntic, structured, relational futures, the accidentals are often essential.\n\nSimultaneously radiant and self-idealizing, dynamically new and obsolete,\nthe web challenges us to reset our editorial thresholds within its spectrum and to\n\n \n\ngrapple with the economic, logistical, and theoretical consequences of doing so.

And in what-\never professional networks, collaborations, open fields, or institutional arrange-\nmoenits we engineer to address them, correction—or at least a better appreciation of\nits consequences—miust have a place.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. This is an argument about scholarly labor and attention—not necessarily an argu-\n\nment against error, which has its own unique functions, as Johnson suggests. Kathryn\n\n \n\nSchultz argues in her recent book Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error that\n\n \n\n“wrongness is a vital part of how we learn and change” (5). According to Daniel Rourke,\n“errors, noise and mistake” might encode some of the more exciting possibilities of the\nweb’s technical and creative evolution.\n\n2. Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Planned Obsolescence offers a terrific survey of these top-\nics and the discussions they have generated.\n\n3. Trettien offers a fascinating tour of “zombie editions” of Milton and their assorted\n\n \n\nerrors. See Esposito for a related discussion of the errors in the public domain copy of\nPride and Prejudice preloaded on Amazon’s Kindle, driving from the original print source,\ndigital scans, OCR, and metadata.\n\n4, What counts as an error? Rather than precisely defining or categorizing them, this\nessay considers errors in a differential relation with the labor of correcting them, a rela-\ntion that changes with historical and production contexts.\n\n5. That is not unusual, according to long-time academic copyeditor Sylvia Hunter:\n“(clopy (or manuscript) editors are rarely mentioned on journal mastheads; we seldom\nmake our way into authors’ acknowledgement footnotes; we toil in silence, invisible” (8).\n\n6. One might imagine the great Victor Borges’s routine on “Phonetic Pronuncia-\ntion.”\n\n7. Some telling perspectives from the field: As Merill Perlman, former chief of copy\n\ndesks at the New York Times, sarcas\n\n \n\nically complains, “Who needs copy editors? They just\nget in the way. Without them, blog postings can go up faster; without them, readers get a\nwriter's words unfiltered; without them, a publication can save lots of money” (Thomas).\nSylvia Hunter suggests “that some scholarly journal publishers in the United States were\nconsidering, or had already begun, phasing out the crucial stages between final manu-\nscript submission and typesetting. In other words-~neatly defeating all of our own well-\n\nreasoned arguments about the value added to res\n\n \n\nch by scholarly publishers-—slapping\na nice cover on exactly the same text that the author has already posted on her Web site”\n(7). Adam Deville blames electronic writing and publishing for putting increasing pres-\nsure on the decreasing resources of copyediting. My own experience as an “editor” ata new\nmedia company came to a close in the early 2000s when nearly the entire editorial depart-\nment was laid off; the management and the technical staff survived.\n\n8.

            "result": " \n\nThe Digital Humanities Moment\n\nMATTHEW K. GOLD\n\n. ecent coverage of the digital humanities (DH) in popular publications such\n\nas the New York Times, Nature, the Boston Globe, the Chronicle of Higher\nuk “A Education, and Inside Higher Ed has confirmed that the digital humani-\nties is not just “the next big thing? as the Chronicle claimed in 2009, but simply\n\n  \n  \n\n“the Thing,” as the same publication noted in 2011 (Pannapacker), At a time when\nmany academic institutions are facing austerity budgets, department closings, and\nstaffing shortages, the digital humanities experienced a banner year that saw clus-\nter hires at multiple universities, the establishment of new digital humanities cen-\nters and initiatives across the globe, and multimillion-dollar grants distributed by\nfederal agencies and charitable foundations. Even Google entered the fray, making\na series of highly publicized grants to DH scholars (Orwant).\n\nClearly, this is a significant moment of growth and. opportunity for the field,\nbut it has arrived amid larger questions concerning the nature and purpose of the\nuniversity system. At stake in the rise of the digital humanities is not only the viabil-\nity of new research methods (such as algorithmic approaches to large humanities\ndata sets) or new pedagogical activities (such as the incorporation of geospatial data\ninto classroom projects) but also key elements of the larger academic ecosystem that\nsupports such work. Whether one looks at the status of peer review, the evolving\nnature of authorship and collaboration, the fundamental interpretive methodolo-\ngies of humanities disciplines, or the controversies over tenure and casualized aca-\ndemic labor that have increasingly rent the fabric of university life, it is easy to see\nthat the academy is shifting in significant ways.\n\nAnd the digital humanities, more than most fields, seems positioned to address\nmany of those changes. The recently created international group 4Humanities, for\ninstance, argues that the digital humanities community has a “special potential and\nresponsibility to assist humanities advocacy” because of its expertise in “making cre-\native use of digital technology to advance humanities research and teaching” (“Mis-\nsion”).

            "result": "MATTHEW K. GOLD\n\nof academic life as we know it, even as (and perhaps because) it upends academic\nlife as we know it.\n\nWe've come a long way from Father Busa’s digital concordances.' Indeed,\nthe rapid ascent of the digital humanities in the public imagination and the con-\ncomitant expansion of its purview have masked, and at times threatened to over-\nshadow, decades of foundational work by scholars and technologists who engaged\nin “digital humanities” work before it was known by that name.’ Though longtime\npractitioners, having weathered decades of suspicion from more traditional col-\nleagues, have largely welcomed an influx of newcomers into the field—the theme\nof the 2011 Digital Humanities Conference was “The Big Tent,” a metaphor much\nebated in the pages that follow—some DHers have found the sudden expansion\nof the community to be disconcerting. Indeed, fault lines have emerged within\nthe DH community between those who use new digital tools to aid relatively tra-\nitional scholarly projects and those who believe that DH is most powerful as a\nisruptive political force that has the potential to reshape fundamental aspects of\n\n2\n\ncademic practice?\nAs the digital humanities has received increasing attention and newfound\ncachet, its discourse has grown introspective and self-reflexive. In the aftermath of\n\nct\n\nhe 2011 Modern Language Association Convention, many members of the field\n\nQ\n\nngaged in a public debate about what it means to be a “digital humanist.” The\nlebate was sparked by University of Nebraska scholar Stephan Ramsay, whose talk\nat the convention was bluntly titled “Who's In and Who’s Out.” Having been asked\nby the roundtable session organizer to deliver a pithy, three-minute-long take on\nthe digital humanities, Ramsay noted increasingly capacious definitions of the field\n(“|DH] has most recently tended to welcome anyone and anything exemplifying a\ncertain wired fervor,’ he noted) before delivering, with the mock-serious pretension\n\n \n\nthat it would settle the matter once and for all, the pronouncement that, yes, there are\nsome basic requirements one must fulfill before calling oneself a digital humanist:\n“Digital Humanities is not some airy Lyceum. It is a series of concrete instantiations\ninvolving money, students, funding agencies, big schools, little schools, programs,\ncurricula, old guards, new guards, gatekeepers, and prestige. ... Do you have to know\nhow to code [to bea digital humanist]? Pm a tenured professor of digital humanities\nand I say ‘yes. ... Personally, I think Digital Humanities is about building things. ...\nIf you are not making anything, you are not ...a digital humanist” (Ramsay, “Who's\nIn and Who’s Out”). Predictably, these comments set off an intense debate during\nthe session itself and in the ensuing online discussions. Ramsay wrote a follow-up\nblog post in which he softened his stance—moving from “coding” as a membership\nrequirement to the less specific “building’—but he still noted that the fundamental\ncommonality that can be found among digital humanists “involves moving from\nreading and critiquing to building and making” (Ramsay, “On Building”).\n\nThese recent, definitional conversations bear the mark of a field in the midst of\ngrowing pains as its adherents expand from a small circle of like-minded scholars\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:54:55 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

They also signal the ways in which the applied model of digital humani-\nties work portends significant shifts in the nature of humanities scholarship. When\na DH scholar attempts to include within her tenure dossier (if, indeed, the scholar\nis even on a tenure track and not one of a growing set of “alt-academics™) not\nonly articles and books but also, for example, code for a collaboratively built tool\nthat enables other scholars to add descriptive metadata to digitized manuscripts,\nkey questions about the nature of scholarship are raised. Several essays within this\nvolume deal with such questions, and institutions such as the Modern Language\nAssociation have compiled guides to help DH scholars begin to answer them (“The\nEvaluation of Digital Work”).\n\nSimilar definitional debates can be found in the pages that follow. Where, for\ninstance, does new media studies leave off and digital humanities begin? Does DH\nneed theory? Does it have a politics? Is it accessible to all members of the profes-\nsion, or do steep infrastructural requirements render entry prohibitive for practi-\n\n \n\ntioners working at small colleges or cash-strapped public universities? Are DHers\ntoo cliquish? Do social media platforms like Twitter trivialize DH’s professional dis-\n\n \n\ncourse? Can DH provide meaningful opportunities to scholars seeking alternatives\nto tenure-track faculty employment? Can it save the humanities? The university?\n\nThese questions and others have vexed the public discourse around the digital\nhumanities for a few years now, but to date such discussions have taken place pre-\ndominantly on listservs, blogs, and Twitter. Few attempts have been made to col-\nlect and curate the debates in a more deliberate fashion, with the result that some\n\n \n\nconversations, especially those on Twitter—a platform used extensively by digital\nhumanists—are hopelessly dispersed and sometimes even impossible to reconsti-\ntute only a few months after they have taken place.\n\nDebates in the Digital Humanities seeks to redress this gap and to assess the state\nof the field by articulating, shaping, and preserving some of the vigorous debates\nsurrounding the rise of the digital humanities. It is not a comprehensive view of\nDH or even an all-encompassing portrait of the controversies that surround it, but\nit does represent an attempt to clarify key points of tension and multiple visions\nof a rapidly shifting landscape. The contributors who provide these visions have\na range of perspectives; included among them are some of the most well-known\nsenior figures in the field, well-established midcareer scholars, rising junior schol-\nars, “#alt-ac” digital humanists, and graduate students. This mix of new and sea-\nsoned voices mirrors the openness of digital humanities itself and reflects its strong\ntradition of mentorship and collaboration.\n\nThe collection builds upon and extends the pioneering volumes that have pre-\nceded it, such as A Companion to the Digital Humanities (Schreibman, Siemens,\nand Unsworth) and A Companion to Digital Literary Studies (Schreibman and\nSiemens), as well as newer and forthcoming collections such as The American Lit-\nerary Scholar in the Digital Age (Earhart and Jewell), Switching Codes: Thinking\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:54:55 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\nXI\n\f"

Scheinfeldt), and\nTeaching Digital Humanities (Hirsch). In the spirit of those texts and in line with\nthe open-source ethos of the digital humanities, this volume will be published as\nboth a printed book and an expanded, open-access webtext. The University of Min-\nnesota Press is to be much commended for its willingness to share the volume in\nthis way, a feature that will significantly extend the reach of the book.\n\nThis collection is not a celebration of the digital humanities but an interroga-\ntion of it. Several essays in the volume level pointed critiques at DH for a variety\nof ills: a lack of attention to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; a preference\nfor research-driven projects over pedagogical ones; an absence of political commit-\nment; an inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; an inability to address\ntexts under copyright; and. an institutional concentration in well-funded research\nuniversities. Alongside these critiques are intriguing explorations of digital humani-\nties theories, methods, and practices. From attempts to delineate new theories of\ncoding as scholarship to forward-looking visions of trends in big data, the volume\nsketches out some of the directions in which the field is moving.\n\nAnd the field of digital humanities does move quickly; the speed of discourse\nin DH is often noted with surprise by newcomers, especially at conferences, when\nTwitter feeds buzz with links to announcements, papers, prototypes, slides, white\npapers, photos, data visualizations, and collaborative documents. By the typical\nstandards of the publishing industry, this text has seen a similarly rapid pace of\ndevelopment, going from first solicitation of essays to published book in less than\na year. To have a collection of this size come together with such speed is, to put\nit mildly, outside the norms of print-based academic publishing. That it did so is\na tribute to the intensity of the debates, the strength of the submissions, and the\nresponsiveness of the press. But it is also a testimonial to the collaborative pro-\ncess through which the book was produced, a feature seen most clearly in the peer\nreview that it received.\n\nThe book, in fact, went through three distinct stages of peer review, each of\nwhich required separate revisions: the first and most innovative process was a semi-\npublic peer-to-peer review, in which contributors commented on one another’s\nwork. Essays then went through an editor's review, which was followed finally by a\ntraditional blind review administered by the press.\n\nThe semipublic peer-to-peer review was modeled on a number of recent exper-\niments in peer review, most notably Noah Wardrip-Fruin’s Expressive Processing\n(2008), Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s Planned Obsolescence (2009), Shakespeare Quar-\nterly’s “Shakespeare and New Media” issue (2010), and Trebor Scholz’s Learning\nthrough Digital Media (2011). In all of these cases, CommentPress, a WordPress\nblog theme built by the Institute for the Future of the Book, was used to pub-\nlish draft manuscripts on a site where comments could be added to the margin\nbeside particular paragraphs of the text (Fitzpatrick, “CommentPress”).

For Debates\nin the Digital Humanities, we chose to go with a semipublic option, meaning that\nthe site was password protected and accessible only to the scholars involved in its\nroduction. Draft essays were placed on the site along with a list of review assign-\nmoenits; each contributor was responsible for adding comments to at least one other\ntext. The process was not blind: reviewers knew who had written the text they were\nreading, and their comments were published under their own names. Often, debates\netween contributors broke out in the margins of the text.\n\nWhether measured quantitatively or qualitatively, the peer-to-peer review pro-\ncess was effective. In the space of two weeks, the thirty essays that went through the\nrocess received 568 comments—an average of nearly twenty comments per essay\n(the median number of comments received was eighteen). Many contributors went\n‘ar beyond the single essay that had been assigned to them, commenting on as many\nas half of the essays in the volume. Lest skeptics assume that a nonblind review pro-\ncess leads inevitably to superficial praise or even to a mild suppression of negative\n\n \n\needback, it should be noted that several features of the peer-to-peer review worked\nagainst such possibilities. The semipublic nature of the review meant that the names\nof reviewers were attached to the comments they left; a failure to leave substantive\ncomments would have reflected poorly on the reviewer’s own work. The fact that\nreview assignments were shared openly among the circle of contributors created\na sense of peer pressure that made it difficult for reviewers to shirk their duties.\nAnd because the peer-to-peer review was not fully open to the public, contributors\nseemed comfortable providing negative criticism in a more open fashion than they\nmight have had the platform been fully public.\n\nThe peer-to-peer review website wound up imparting a sense of community\nand collectivity to the project as a whole. It also gave contributors a better sense\nof the full volume in its prepublished state. Whereas contributors to edited col-\nlections typically gain a vision of the entire book only when it is finally printed,\ncontributors to Debates in the Digital Humanities were able to see the work of their\npeers while revising their own essays. This led some authors not only to thank fel-\nlow contributors in their acknowledgments for feedback given during peer-to-peer\nreview but also to cite one another’s essays and peer reviews. In short, rather than\nserving solely as a gate-keeping mechanism, this review process built a sense of\ncohesion around the project itself. And it was followed and supplemented by more\ntraditional forms of review that provided opportunities for the kind of unfiltered\ncriticism typically associated with blind review. Ultimately, this hybrid, semio-\npen, multistage model of peer review incorporated the innovations of completely\nopen models of peer-to-peer review while retaining the strengths of more tradi-\ntional processes.\n\nThe resulting text reflects the range of issues facing the digital humanities at\nthe present time.

That volume dealt not just with those parts of a text that typically\n\nby\n\nwere relegated to the bibliographical margins (titles, annotations, marginalia, etc.)\nbut also with those features of textual discourse (race, gender, sexual orientation,\nclass, among others) that had been marginalized in discussions of textual scholar-\nship. The collection had. been prompted by the discovery that in some otherwise\nhighly regarded academic institutions, a scholarly edition, bibliography, or textual\nstudy counted as only one half of a “real” book in promotion and tenure decisions.\nThe critical hardback monograph was the gold standard by which scholarly and\nintellectual achievernent was to be measured.\n\nNow, a decade and more later, it is unclear whether that institutional prejudice\nagainst bibliographical and editorial work has been overcome or whether it has been\ncompounded by a newer dismissive attitude, this time toward digital and electronic\n“publications.” Since the great majority of new scholarly editions established in the\nlast twenty years and more have some prominent digital component (electronic\ntext, hyperlinks and hypermedia, and so on), if the institutional marginalization\nof text has been joined by a similar prejudice (or, at best, an equivocal attitude)\ntoward medium, then those of us working with electronic text are confronted with\na double whammy in an increasingly competitive academic atmosphere. Put in a\nrelated form: is the very concept of digital humanities (DH) seen in some quarters\nas an oxymoron, the passing off of techné as if it were critique; and, a fortiori, if\nthis oxymoronic DH is concerned with the production of textual or bibliographical\nresources, are those scholars engaging in such pursuits under a two-fold suspicion\nby the general community of “humanists”?\n\nIn a short essay describing the potential problem, it is unlikely that we will\nfind a smoking gun or that the usual cloak of confidentiality regarding tenure and\npromotion will be sufficiently lifted to provide a clear view of academic predispo-\nsitions.

The ongoing series of New York Times\narticles on “Humanities 2.0”; the citing of blogs as evidence in the popular press;\nthe use of Twitter and digital phones in recent political movements (Iran, Egypt,\nTunisia, Yemen); and the continued, perhaps exacerbated, concerns of government\nwith the control of copyright in digital environments—all of these features of what\nBourdieu calls “fields” of “cultural production”—show that the electronic environ-\nmient is a persistent and well-traversed area of our common discourse. Whether that\ndiscourse will admit digital bibliographical scholarship, digital editing, and digital\ntextuality as academic credentials is another matter.\n\nAs in the case of the earlier “Resistance” essay, this problem can be seen as one\nof rhetoric (though recognizing that this usage is not meant to undervalue the very\nreal and practical concerns of scholars, particularly younger scholars, facing the\ncareer-determining decisions of review committees). Thus, in the first issue of Dig-\nital Humanities Quarterly (DHQ, whose very title shows an indebtedness to, or\ndesire to connect with, an established “print” mode of production), Joseph Raben’s\napologia “Tenure, Promotion and Digital Publication”) makes much of the fact\nthat DHQ is a“a totally online scholarly publication,’ while at the same time noting\nthat “the absence of parallel publications in other sectors of humanities research is a\nmeasure of the distance still to be traveled before computer publishing is regarded\nas fully equal to the book and the print journal.” Raben puts the issue very starkly\nwhen he recognizes that some potential contributors to DHQ may be all too aware\nthat “appearance in electronic media is not as highly regarded. by the gatekeepers\nof tenure and promotion as the traditional hard-bound book and the article off-\nprint, at least in the humanities.” The enthusiastic embrace of electronic work by\nsuch senior scholars as Jerome J. McGann (whose hypermedia archive of Dante\n\n \n\nGabriel Rossetti and such foundational critical writings as the “Rationale of Hyper-\nText” have provided a paradigm for DH) has to be measured against the reluctance\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:50 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\n| 439\n\f"

Thomas Tanselle, who is generally regarded as the\nexemplary contemporary figure in the continuity of the print-based Greg-Bowers\nschool of “copytext” editing, was (unexpectedly) brought in (co-opted) by the Mod-\nern Language Association (MLA) to write a preface to the volume on Electronic Tex-\ntual Editing, in which he discounted the “hyperbolic writing and speaking about the\ncomputer age, as if the computer age were basically discontinuous with what went\nbefore” and warned that “when the excitement leads to the idea that the computer\nalters the ontology of texts and makes possible new kinds of reading and analysis, it\nhas gone too far” (Tanselle). I share Tanselle’s view that much of what Paul Duguid\nhas pointedly referred to as early “liberation technology” by computer proselytes\nplaced the rhetoric of DH in a dangerously vertiginous position. And I also agree\nthat, if DH is to be accorded a recognizable and stable position in academic writ-\ning, it must not cut itself loose from the textual and critical history that precedes it.\nAs L have remarked elsewhere, I would maintain that the rhetorical stance of Mat-\nthew G. Kirschenbaum’s Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination\n(in which digital forensics is linked to the bibliographical principles of W. W. Greg,\nFredson Bowers, and G. Thomas Tanselle) is not just an appropriate ideological tac-\ntic but may also serve to head off the potential ghettoization of DH and electronic\nediting with it.\n\nBut how far has the ghettoization already gone; and, in the absence of the smok-\ning gun, how do we measure the “resistance” of my title? In his brief introduction\nto the scholarly mandate of DHQ, Raben cites some disturbing statistics from a\n2006-7 MLA Report of the MLA Task Force on Evaluating Scholarship for Tenure\nand Promotion. Raben concentrates on the findings that “40.8% of departments in\ndoctorate-granting institutions report no experience in evaluating refereed articles\nin electronic format, and 65.7% report no experience in evaluating monographs in\nelectronic format,’ although 88.9 percent of doctorate-granting institutions rate the\npublication of a monograph as “very important” or “important” for tenure. These\nstatistics are telling enough, but the report itself contains much more that should\nbe of continuing concern to DH practitioners. It is hardly promising that across the\nboard, only 28.1 percent of departments considered monographs in electronic for-\nmat “important” to the evaluation of scholarship, and overall “[r|efereed articles in\ndigital media count for tenure and promotion in less than halfas many departments\nas refereed articles in print, and “|m]onographs in electronic formats have a place\nin the evaluation of scholarship for tenure and promotion in only about one-third\nas many departments as print monographs” (MLA Report of the Task Force, 43-44).\nThere is clearly a suspicion that somehow the “open access” principles of a good deal\nof electronic scholarship produce a less than rigorous evaluation procedure than in\ntraditional print contexts.

The MLA report finds that such rigorous schol-\narly procedures are now evident in electronic journals, which are “increasingly run\nby editorial boards committed to peer review” (44). The institutional paradox is\nthat while “digital forms of scholarship increasingly pervade academic life, work in\nthis area has not yet received proper recognition when candidates are evaluated for\npromotion and tenure” (44). It is impossible to estimate how many younger schol-\nars may hesitate to begin work on digital projects, knowing (or sensing) that their\nlabors will count for less during the important career-making moments, a challenge\nthat I think may be compounded when the electronic scholarship is editorial or bib-\nliographical. So although I can testify from thirty years involvement with the inter-\ndisciplinary Society for Textual Scholarship that the proportion of younger (and,\nL believe, of female) participants in recent conferences has greatly increased in the\nlast decade or so, we must wonder how many of these younger people will make it\ninto even the midranks of the profession.\n\nWhat is this scholarly environment as it promotes (or fails to promote) digital\nand digital textual work? The MLA report was published only five years ago; and\nwhile at several points its authors look toward a more collegial institutional atmo-\nsphere in the near future, we should not expect that moment to have yet arrived.\nNonetheless, in part as a response to the grim findings of the report, the MLA has\nbeen in the forefront of an attempt to make literature and language scholars and\nadministrators more familiar with digital work and its demands.\n\nIn a very helpful e-mail correspondence, Stephen Olsen (associate director\nof research and manager of digital services at the MLA) points to a number of\nsuch “outreach” programs by and within the MLA, including a series of electronic\nroundtables at the annual conventions, together with presentations of digital proj-\nects at individual computer stations. Workshops on evaluating digital scholarship\nare also organized at the MLA, as they are at Association of Departments of Eng-\nlish (ADE) and Association of Departments of Foreign Languages (ADFL; espe-\ncially notable being the summer seminars for administrators). The MLA Guide-\nlines for Evaluating Work with Digital Media in the Modern Languages together\nwith several important publications by the ADE (see Fitzpatrick, “Planned Obso-\nlescence”; Hayles, “How We Read”; and Kirschenbaum, “What Is Digital Humani-\nties?”) have emerged from the summer seminars and are now available on the ADE\nwebsite.

Similarly, Michael\nBérubé, director of the Institute for Arts and Humanities and Paterno family profes-\nsor in literature at Pennsylvania State University and coauthor of the MLA report,\nfinds that “forms of scholarship other than the monograph are absurdly devalued\nin some quarters” but that the work of Kirschenbaum and others is “beginning\nto change things .. . however gradually.’ A less hopeful diagnosis (and prognosis)\nis offered by Stephen Ramsay, associate professor in English at the University of\nNebraska~Lincoln and a fellow in the Center for Digital Research in the Humani-\nties, in an e-mail and phone conversation about recent case histories. Ramsay noted\nthat such cases “provide a sad commentary on the state of DH acceptance. Just\nwhen I think we've arrived, [these cases] remind me that in some quarters things\nare precisely as they were when I started (fifteen years or so ago).” Ramsay also feels\nthat there may be an institutional “fear” of some of the more technical (and less\n“humanistic”) aspects of DH, especially quantification and data mining, but that,\nfor institutions like his own University of Nebraska, DH offers an opportunity to\ncreate an academic and intellectual “presence” that would not have been available\nin predigital days.\n\nThe problem may be, as both Ramsay and Bérubé suggest, that during a period\nof transition it may be particularly difficult to determine where we are in the unfold-\ning of that transition (and even more difficult to predict when and if DH will have\nbeen fully accepted as a “respectable” element in humanities research).

So the “hopeful signs” that Eaves looks for may depend on\nwhat “flavor” of DH is being offered.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the sheer range of DH projects, institutes, and\nscholarly investment has increased enormously in the last decade or so.

Among the concerns raised were\nthose similar to the MLA report, for example, that while “new faculty are brave and\nwill try new stuff? in terms of “career incentives,” they are “worried about what\nthey’re judged on” because “[h] umanities are rewarded by publishing a book” (Proj-\nect Bamboo, “Exercise 6A Scribe Notes”).

My money is on the next generation of scholars we are producing at the\nGraduate Center, who I believe will carry the DH banner into the next phase of\ntheir academic careers.\n\nThe two most striking elements of this testimony from an administrator (rather\nthan the faculty and students recorded in the Bamboo conversations) are (1) the\nrecognition that the impetus for institutional and scholarly advances in DH comes\nprimarily from graduate students and only secondarily from doctoral faculty, and\n(2) there will be no easy or quick transformation toward DH within the “conven-\ntional academic arenas.” This latter prognosis reflects the uncertainties expressed\nby Ramsay and others about our current position in the progress of DH. The fact\nthat the support of DH within the Graduate Center comes from two levels—the top\nadministration and the present and future students—does reinforce that frequent\ncomplaint within Bamboo that the problems lie with entrenched senior faculty and\nwith the departments they represent, and this condition is doubtless widespread\nin the current academy. There is, however, one further part of Brier’s institutional\ndescription that may make movement within CUNY easier than at other gradu-\nate and doctoral programs.

(at worst) an outright hostility. This same administrator wrote that “when I\ncompare [the candidate’s] scholarly and professional activities to some elsewhere in\nthe college who have achieved promotion to Associate Professor, I cannot see that\n[the candidate] has been less successful than them in showing a persistent, dedi-\ncated engagement with getting articles published and with involvement in a variety\nof professional activities.” It is, of course, very unlikely that a department denying\ntenure and promotion will be overtly dismissive of all forms of digital scholarship;\nbut, when such a denial invokes the hoary distinction of “form” (i.e., medium)\nover “substance,” it seems fairly clear that this is indeed another “resistance” to the\nnew medium: the negative evaluation from the department includes the comment\nthat “|t]he evidence presented for the pedagogical value of [the candidate's] work\nin digital humanities appears to pride form over substance.” There are those who\nhave apparently still not been able to accept the dicta of Marshall McLuhan and for\nwhom “medium” continues to be a nonsubject.

In brief, the report\non the digitization of the five hundred billion words makes clear that the research\nshould illuminate such fields as “lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective\nmemory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and histori-\ncal epidemiology” and that this new “culturomics ... extends the boundaries of rig-\norous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social\nsciences and the humanities” (Michel).\n\nDespite the evidence of the report itself (e.g., that the Nazi repression of refer-\nences to Marc Chagall is very clearly documentable by the word frequency statis-\ntics, with only a single mention in German from 1933 through 1944), in the Times\ncoverage of the research the well-known critic Louis Menand found the value of\nthe statistics limited and claims for its relevance to humanities overblown. While\nacknowledging that the Google Books NGram Viewer could be particularly use-\nful for linguists, he suggested that “obviously some of the claims (about cultural\nhistory] are a little exaggerated” (Menand). He was also troubled that, among the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:50 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\n| 447\n\f"

I share\nMenand’s unease that there appear to have been no humanists on board (unless\none counts linguists in this group) and certainly nobody representing history\nof the book. In subsequent e-mail correspondence, Menand elaborated on his\nconcerns: “What I had in mind was the various things the authors of the paper\nclaimed to have proved by counting changes in the number of words or phrases.\nL thought it was a completely superficial way to do cultural history. Its not that\nthe data might not be relevant, but you'd have to do a lot more work before you\ncould make some of the claims they were making—hence my noting that they did\nnot have a humanist on their team. They seemed to think this could be a purely\nempirical exercise.”\n\n \n\nMenand’s demurrals are well taken, and doubtless the involvement of a repre-\nsentative group of humanists would have affected the interpretative positions that\nthe report covers. But I am less certain that quantitative analyses are a “superficial”\nway to provide information for “cultural history.” If that were so, then the research of\nthe annaliste school of French history (challenging the previously dominant “great-\nfigure” focus) would be vitiated in relegating its data and, yes, its quantification to\na form of nonhumanistic “counting.” It does indeed require a humanistic interven-\ntion to try to characterize the raw evidence of the so-called Ngrams that the Google-\npowered research recorded and analyzed (and admittedly there has been some com-\nplaint that the Ngrams may be based on “dirty” data). But when the authors of the\nreport on the perhaps unfortunately named. “culturomics” note that the research\nshould illuminate various “humanistic” fields and that this new “culturomics .. .\nextends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phe-\nnomena” spanning the social sciences and the humanities, ] am not sure that these\nclaims are necessarily “exaggerated” (Michel). In the Chagall example, the quantifi-\nable “disappearance” in German-language publications during the Nazi years has to\nbe set against the continued presence of the artist in languages other than German\nthroughout the Nazi hegemony; and, even in German, the references pick up again\nafter 1945. This quantification is “superficial” only in the sense that it provides a\nnumerical series of raw facts; but the moment that we place these mere facts against\nthe template of mid-twentieth-century political history, an interpretive strategy is\nforced upon us, a strategy that can then be checked and if necessary modified by\nrunning other Ngrams involving other Jewish and non-Jewish) painters, other art\nforms, other places and types of publication, and other historical periods. Menand\nis right that the Ngram in and of itself does not prove anything beyond the limited\nvalues encoded in the statistics; but I suspect that much of the “resistance” that the\n\n \n\ntraditional culture critic finds in culturomics is derived from the combination of\nthe quantification itself and its being presented in a digital (.e., machine-produced\nand machine-readable) format.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:50 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

            "result": "The Resistance to Digital Humanities\n\nIn other words, the addition of digitization to quantification makes the data\nseem even less humanistic and critical. The resistance is simply a more recent form\nof that distrust of “detail” that Julia Flanders finds in stylometrics and related\n“pedantic” studies. She cites a 1989 review of John Burrows, Computation into\nCriticism: “From his pages of tables, graphs, and figures he proves that each of\nthe characters under consideration [from Jane Austen’s novels] has his or her own\nidiolect ... While there seems to be no reason—or at least none that a non-statistician\ncan see—to doubt the validity of his findings, the thought does occur as to whether\nfive years of work ... by Professor Burrows to tell his readers this was really neces-\nsary” (La Faye, 429). Flanders notes that La Faye has misunderstood Burrows’s argu-\nment; but, in addition, the relevance of the review is its resistance to (and devalu-\nation of) the pedantry required. to produce a quantifiable result—much the same\nposition of the antiphilological critics I cited in the predecessor to this article (e.g.,\nthat “the prestige of fiddling with minute variants and bibliographical details should\nbe low” [Sisson, 616]).\n\nIn the various forms of “resistance” encountered in this essay, I think we can\nsee that the critical dismissal of Ngrams and culturomics, the devaluing of digital-\nbased research, the institutional unwillingness to regard work conducted in an elec-\ntronic medium as on a par with print, and the related continuation of the “gold\nstandard” of the monograph in tenure and promotion decisions are all symptoms\nof the fact that, to cite again Morris Eave’s colorful figure, the rat has not yet been\ndigested by the python.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis report inevitably depends on leads and information provided by a number of prac-\ntitioners of DH, some of them contributors to this volume.

Zwischen 1973 und 1997 wurden insgesamt gut 1800\nHandschriften nach Island iiberfiihrt, darunter der bereits erwihnte Codex Re-\ngius der Alteren Edda sowie das Kompendium der Flateyjarbdk, ebenso Gesetzes-\ntexte, christliche Werke und Islindersagas. Es gibt keinen eigenen Katalog tiber\ndie Sammlungen am islandischen Institut, aber da die Signaturen unverandert\ngeblieben sind, kann man die alten Kataloge benutzen. Dies ist nur insofern ein\nProblem, als man an der Signatur nicht mehr ablesen kann, ob sich die Hand-\nschrift in Danemark oder Island befindet. Aber der Aufbewahrungsort lasst sich\nheutzutage leicht mit Hilfe digitaler Kataloge im Internet abkliren. In den Ar-\nnamagneanischen Sammlungen in Danemark wie in Reykjavik wird an solchen\nKatalogen gearbeitet. Listen iiber die am Ort befindlichen Manuskripte gibt es\nauf der Homepage der Institute (S. 615-617). Im Registerband des ONP ist\nebenfalls eine solche Liste abgedruckt.\n\nAuch die islindische Nationalbibliothek, Landsbékasafn Islands, verfiigt iiber\neine grofe Handschriftensammiung, die jedoch meist jiingeres islindisches Ma-\nterial beinhaltet. Ein Kleinod ist hingegen das sogenannte Kringla-Blatt, das ein-\nzige erhaltene Blatt des wichtigsten Heimskringla-Manuskriptes, der Kringla (ca.\n1260), das Island 1975 als Geschenk von Schweden erhielt. Zu dieser Sammlung\ngibt es einen gedruckten Katalog: Skrd um handritaséfu Landsbokasafnsins (3 Bde.\n+ 4 Supplementbde. Reykjavik 1918-1996).\n\n \n\nNamen von Handschriften und Werken\n\nBevor Handschriften in groSen Bibliotheken gesammelt und das Signatursystem\neingefiihrt wurden, war es iiblich, sich mit Namen auf sie zu beziehen. Diese\nNamen sind auch heute noch neben den Signaturen in Gebrauch; oft ist es prak-\ntischer, sich mit einem Namen auf eine Handschrift zu beziehen als mit einer\nSignatur. Die meisten verbinden z.B. mehr mit dem Namen »Flateyjarbék® als\nmit der Signatur ,GKS 1005 fol. Mehrere Biicher erhielten ihren Namen nach\neinem Ort. Das muss nicht der Ort sein, an dem sie geschrieben wurden, es kann\nsich auch um die Stelle handeln, an der sie zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt auf-\nbewahrt wurden und dem sie fortan verbunden blieben, Die Saga-Handschrift\nMédruvallabdk (AM 132 fol) tragt ihren Namen nach dem Kloster Médruvellir,\ndas sich in einem Besitzervermerk im Buch erwahnt findet. Die Gesetzeshand-\nschrift Skardsbdk (AM 350 fol) bekam Arni Magnusson zwar in Kopenhagen,\naber ein friiherer Besitzer hatte auf dem Hof Skard an der Westkiiste Islands\ngewohnt.

All these arguments suggest that the term is indeed tactical, by which I mean\nthat attempts to arrive at models, mappings, and definitions—with concomitant\nimplications for who’s in and who’s out, what is and what isn’t, and appropriate\nratios of “hack” to “yack”—are often self-defeating, not only because they are some-\ntimes divisive, but also because they risk effacing the material history of the term as\nit has evolved within individual institutions over roughly the last decade.\n\nTo assert that digital humanities is a “tactical” coinage is not simply to indulge\nin neopragmatic relativism. Rather, it is to insist on the reality of circumstances in\nwhich it is unabashedly deployed to get things done—“things” that might include\ngetting a faculty line or funding a staff position, establishing a curriculum, revamp-\ning a lab, or launching a center.

They use it daily to share information, establish contacts, ask and\nanswer questions, bullshit, banter, rant, vent, kid, and carry on. The significance,\nhowever, is not just in people using Twitter to tweet at like-minded others but also\nin the algorithmic and ecological ways that the network effects of the online digi-\ntal humanities “community” are reified and refracted through a range of different\naggregators, reputation generators, metrical indicators, and status markers to pres-\nent a visible and reified topology for the digital humanities as a whole. The obvious\nfact that not every digital humanist is actually on Twitter is thus beside the point for\npurposes of this argument.

Not only does the lack of an interrogative in\nthe title furnish an up-front answer to the question posed by the earlier seminar,\nthe lexical shift to digital humanities already seems a fait accompli. The agenda\nwas also conspicuously more focused, with some two dozen faculty and gradu-\nate students participating as well as (again) a set of visiting speakers and consul-\ntants (myself among them). The key deliverable was a finished syllabus for a newly\ndesigned two-semester course in “Knowledge Representation,” which would form\nthe backbone of the graduate curriculum. Also by 2001, as indicated by a May\n25 address to the Congress of Social Sciences and Humanities, Université Laval,\nQuébec, Unsworth had in hand a draft proposal for a master’s degree in digital\nhumanities to be housed within the newly established program in media studies\nat Virginia?\n\nFor a variety of reasons, this ambitious and prescient proposal for a master’s\nin digital humanities at one of the flagship American institutions for work in the\nfield was never realized. The proposal eventually died somewhere in the Univer-\nsity of Virginia’s administrative ether (how and why it is not my story to tell). But a\ncloser analysis of some of the key documents from this period of institutional self-\nreflection, 1999 through 2002, helps illuminate what I mean by the “tactical” nature\nof digital humanities.\n\nA number of items and records associated with both Virginia seminars remain\npublicly available on the web, and these are instructive (as well as often all too famil-\niar in terms of the kind of questions and “debates”——to echo the present volume’s\ntitle—engaged). This much is clear: by the end of the first semester, the instinct of\nthe group was for keeping “humanities computing” at arm’s length. Indeed, reading\nthe December 10, 1999, minutes, we find a direct rewrite of the governing question\nof the seminar: “Should we have an M.A. in Digital Media?” the document (whose\nelectronic file is titled “conclusions.html”) begins by asking.* “Digital” thus replaces\n“computing,” and “media” has muscled in on “humanities.” Looking further back\nin the online archive to the first meeting for which there are recorded minutes\n(September 24, 1999), we find, immediately after mention of the assigned readings\nfor that week—they are Espen Aarseth’s “Humanistic Informatics and its Relation\nto the Humanities” and Willard McCarty’s “What Is Humanities Computing’ —\nthe following notation: “Opposing models: humanities computing as theoretical\ndiscipline and as a practice based on collegial service.* Theory and “discipline”\nare thus opposed to “service” from the outset. Other oppositions follow: “philol-\nogy” (McCarty) and “hypermedia” (Aarseth), humanities computing as discipline\n(McCarty) versus media studies (Aarseth). The institutional landscape is thus\ndefined as one of media studies versus humanities computing, with McCarty (espe-\n\n \n\ncally) laboring mightily to recapitulate the latter as a scholarly (and theoretical)\nundertaking, as distinct from service-oriented academic computing.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:42 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Concerns over legiti-\nmization, status, and intrainstitutional relationships predominate. “Clear statement\nof central research questions will go a long way toward legitimizing a Digital Media\nprogram and separating it from the ‘collegial service’ model pervasive in Humani-\nties Computing” (http://www.iath.virginia.edu/hes/conclusions.html), the minutes\nof the concluding session record. While still, to some extent, using “humanities com-\nputing” and “digital media” interchangeably, at this point the record of the discus-\nsion also introduces a third term, “knowledge representation.” Originating in the\nwork of John Sowa (who would be an invited guest in the follow-on seminar), it is\npresented as the constitutive element of a humanities computing (or digital media)\nresearch agenda: “The general consensus of the seminar is that this problem should\nbe articulated in terms of ‘knowledge representation’—that we are now confronted\nwith new ways of understanding, creating, and teaching information. The struc-\ntures of and modes of representing that information should be an object of study”\n(http://www.iath. virginia.edu/hces/conclusions.html).\n\nA tactically aware reading of the foregoing would note that tension had clearly\ncentered on the gerund “computing” and its service connotations (and we might\nnote that a verb functioning as a noun occupies a service posture even as a part of\nspeech). “Media,” as a proper noun, enters the deliberations of the group already\nbacked by the disciplinary machinery of “media studies” (also the name of the then\nnew program at Virginia in which the curriculum would eventually be housed) and\nthus seems to offer a safer landing place. In addition, there is the implicit shift in\nemphasis from computing as numeric calculation to media and the representational\nspaces they inhabit—a move also compatible with the introduction of “knowledge\nrepresentation” into the terms under discussion.”\n\nHow we then get from “digital media” to “digital humanities” is an open ques-\ntion. There is no discussion of the lexical shift in the materials available online\nfor the 2001-2 seminar, which is simply titled, ex cathedra, “Digital Humanities\nCurriculum Seminar” The key substitution—“humanities” for “media”—seems\nstraightforward enough, on the one hand serving to topically define the scope of\nthe endeavor while also producing a novel construction to rescue it from the flats\nof the generic phrase “digital media.” And it preserves, by chiasmus, one half of the\nformer appellation, though “humanities” is now simply a noun modified by an\nadjective. In retrospect, then, the real work of the first seminar concerned the move\nfrom humanities computing to digital media, with the subsequent displacement\nof “media” by “humanities” most likely an ancillary maneuver and in any case not\nsomething that the conveners of the second seminar saw fit to comment on overtly\nat the time.\n\nAt this point, some chronological housekeeping is in order.

A third key component was the founding of the Alliance of Digi-\ntal Humanities Organizations shortly thereafter, where Unsworth again played a\ncentral role with digital humanities emerging as the term of choice for this new\ngovernance body——also detailed in my earlier essay. The editors’ introduction to\nthe Blackwell volume, meanwhile, offers some oblique commentary on the matter:\ntitled “The Digital Humanities and Humanities Computing,” it seems to grant the\ntwo terms equal billing, but in fact digital humanities emerges as the wider ranging\nlocution, with humanities computing solidified but circumscribed as its “interdisci-\nplinary core” (Schreibman, Siemens, Unsworth, xxiv). Nonetheless, digital humani-\nties, which would surely have been a novel construction for many readers when the\nvolume first came into their hands in 2004, is never explicitly glossed, merely pre-\nsented. as the de facto name of what the editors declare in their opening sentence\nto be a “field” (xxiii).

He notes only a few scattered. instances of the latter term prior to 2001, all\nof them casual nominal constructions such as “digital humanities object” or “envi-\nronment”; afterwards, “digital humanities” rapidly gains traction until 2006-7 when\nthe usage ratio roughly balances.\n\nThere is one more feature of the aborted Virginia master’s proposal to which 1\nwill briefly call attention. This concerns the question of whether the degree should\nbe a stand-alone offering or whether it should exist as a “track” within an exist-\ning departmental master’s program. The December 1999 minutes put the question\nthis way: “There was some discussion about staying ‘above’ or ‘below the SCHEV\napproval threshold. One option would be to start with a program within an exist-\ning department and work [to] attract students and faculty. When the program is a\nworking success, then we could move to create a separate department. However, the\nseminar group seemed decided that the need for new faculty, facilities, and research\nagendas precludes starting small. Now seems to be the time to campaign aggressively\nfor a large-scale Digital Media program.” SCHEV is the State Council of Higher Edu-\ncation for Virginia, and what’s at stake here is the nature of the approval process that\nwould be required for the new master’s. To establish the degree as an independent\nprogram would eventually require the blessing of this statewide body; to establish\nit within the contours of an existing departmental program would sidestep that\nnecessity. It is clear that there was a mood of confidence in the seminar, a feeling\nthat the moment was right for a big push, one with consequences not only for the\ndegree as such but also at the level of personnel and facilities like classrooms and\nlabs.

Of\ncourse, the end result is obvious: the mappings are self-perpetuating, so that those\nwho are currently identified as influential users in a given topic space will accumu-\nlate even more followers as a result of their visibility through the “Who to Follow”\nfeature, which will in turn contribute to reinforcing their ranking by the algorithm.\n\nSome observers will, of course, suggest that such stuff has been a feature of\nscholarly life since at least the days of the Royal Academy (or maybe Plato’s acad-\nemy). But a better and more specific frame of reference might be the “star sys-\ntem” in literary studies. (The contentious suggestion of a “star system” in digital\nhumanities was memorably lofted in a blog piece by William Pannapacker cover-\ning DH sessions at the 2011 MLA conference in Los Angeles, which is reprinted\nhere.) The scholar most closely identified with a diagnosis and critical analysis\nof the workings of the academic star system is David R. Shumway, who in 1997\nwrote a much-talked-about piece in PMLA on the phenomenon. Shumway, of\ncourse, is himself adopting the phrase from Hollywood, recounting the genealogy\nof “stardom” as a new and distinct form of celebrity manufactured by the studios.\nShumway makes several trenchant points, yoking the emergence of stars in liter-\nary studies not only to the rise of high theory but also to the rise of the interna-\ntional academic conference, the airlines that transport us to them, the ongoing\ninstitutionalization of academic literary studies as a research discipline (and the\nattendant search for legitimization), and the proliferation of images of the pro-\nfessoriate amid the ferment of the culture wars. Ultimately, he concludes that the\nstar system in literary studies is a distinct historical phenomenon that originates\nin the late 1970s; he also concludes that the disproportionate resources required to\nmaintain it likely contribute to the unhealthy rise of contingent labor and the gen-\neral deterioration of academic working conditions. Moreover, he sees it as serving\nto undermine the public’s confidence in the academy by diluting the authority of\nthe rank-and-file professoriate.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:42 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "Digital Humanities As/Is a Tactical Term\n\nSeveral of Shumway’s characterizations of the star system map all too easily\nonto digital humanities. The management of public image, for example: we do this\nboth trivially in the form of avatars as well as more substantively through our daily\nonline “presences” on blogs, Twitter, listservs, and more. Likewise, its worth not-\ning that, like “high theory,’ the digital humanities is routinely positioned as a kind\nof metadiscourse (or methodology) that cuts across individual subdisciplines and\nfields. This is an enormously powerful and seductive base of operations. Most tell-\ningly, for Shumway star quality is not simply a function of public image or the num-\nber of frequent flier miles the academic logs but rather of a specific kind of relation-\nship between consumers, or “fans,” and the celebrity: “It is the feeling of personal\nconnection that transforms the merely famous scholar into a star” (92). In the digital\nhumanities, I would argue, this special relationship is less a function of the perfor-\nmativity of a lecture (most of us are simply not that interesting to watch) than the\nruthless metrics of online community, the frisson that comes from an @reply from\nsomeone more famous than you or yo ll never believe who just started following\nme! For those of us who spend time online in Twitter and (to a lesser degree) other\nsocial networks, including Facebook and the looser tissues of the blogosphere, this\nstar system is reified (and sometimes even quantified or visualized) in the ongoing\naccumulation of network relations that describe—often all too precisely—influence\nand. impact, pitilessly allowing one to locate oneself in the ecosystem at any given\ninstant. This seems to me to go some way toward explaining why there is so much\nanxiety around the Twitter/DH nexus (as reflected in other essays in this volume,\nfor example)—its constant mappings and metrics have come to inhabit that intan-\ngible performative dimension that Shumway earlier ascribed to the public (and in-\nperson) appearances of the high-theory stars.\n\nOnline relationships are eminently portable across the analog/digital mem-\nbrane, so those who are in positions of visibility and impact online reap rewards\nthat have more tangible consequences in meatspace. As Phil Agre reminded us a\nlong time ago, the network is a terrific place to, well, network.” At its best, this can\nbe a great multiplier, or democratizer: the individual with a 4/4 load at an isolated\nteaching institution can wield influence in ways that would have been unthinkable\nin the theory-driven era Shumway describes. That kind of load balancing—no lon-\nger Yale deconstruction or Duke English but centers of influence at big public land-\ngrant institutions or small “teaching colleges”—is dramatically different from the\nstar system characterized by daring publicity stills of Derrida or De Man (of the sort\nShumway reproduced in his essay), or the faux-fanzine Judy. But it is not any less\ndivorced from the real world balance of academic power, which still manifests in the\nform of jobs, grants, publications, invitations, and all the rest of the apparatus that\nShumway’s high-theory stars defined by transcending. As cycles of influence flicker\never more rapidly back and forth between the analog and digital worlds, as tenure\ncommittees in the humanities begin to import impact metrics (citation indices and\n\n \n\nthe like) from the sciences, and as the success stories of the disempowered few who\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:42 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 425\n\f"

It must acknowledge, openly and frankly,\nthat while Twitter (and other online social networks) and DH are not coextensive,\nthe interactions among and between them are real and consequential.\n\nAnd yes, tactical. Networks, as Dianne Rocheleau and Robin Roth remind us,\nare “relational webs shot through with power,’ and “an individual's position within\nthe network is not neutral or arbitrary, but has implications for how the individual\nviews the network and how s/he/it may act within it (or against it)” (434). It's not\njust that our avatars are now the real stars—it’s that stardom (or else simply surviv-\ning) is also now a function of one’s ability to arbitrage influence across all manner\nof networks, “real” and virtual alike.\n\nAnd Not an End\n\nMy own contribution of this essay to this volume at this time is itself ineluctably\ntactical, a positioning and an intervention. But it is not a provocation, or at least\nit is not intended to be. I have brought together some bits of obscure institutional\nhistory dredged from a decade ago and observations about the dynamics of repu-\ntation and community online at the present moment in order to make a simple\npoint: not only is digital humanities constantly in flux, but also the term is one\nwhose mojo may be harnessed, either rhetorically or algorithmically or both, to\nmake a statement, make a change, and otherwise get stuff done. Lately other com-\nmentators have also wanted to insist that digital humanities is a tactical construct,\nbut for them such insistence seems to serve more of a means of disarming the term\nfrom a stance of perceived disenfranchisement. If DH is merely tactical, this line of\nattack goes, it can be outflanked in favor of some alternative nomenclature that is\nmore inclusive, more pluralistic, more democratic, and so forth. This in my view is\nprecisely wrong since it is oblivious to the import of the institutional, material, and\nsocial contexts in which the term digital humanities has already been taken up and\noperationally embedded.\"\n\nWhile not particularly revelatory in and of itself, my “tactical” view of what digi-\ntal humanities really is offers a necessary counterbalance, I believe, to some current\ntensions and debates within the wider community represented in this volume and\nbeyond. Much energy is now being expended on defining what digital humanities\nis, on whether a paper or proposal was accepted or rejected because it was or was\nnot “real” digital humanities, and so forth—as though appeals to higher authorities\ncan transcend the reality that review panels and committees and boards are nearly\nalways staffed by overworked and undercompensated individuals (who are by no\nmeans exclusively tenured or tenure-track faculty) doing what they can do to do\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:42 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Our ‘spine’ in that curriculum went from digitization, data types, database\ndesign, computer languages/programming, interface design, information visualization,\ntext analysis/markup, intellectual property, communities of practice, diversity of com-\nmunities, etc. through a series of units EACH of which had a set of theoretical readings\nAND a set of exercises created for it.

If\nour current use of computers in English studies is marked by any common theme\nat all, it is experimentation at the most basic level. As a profession, we are just\nlearning how to live with computers, just beginning to integrate these machines\neffectively into writing- and reading-intensive courses, just starting to consider the\n\nimplications of the multilayered literacy associated with computers.\n\n—Cynthia Selfe, “Computers in English Departments: The Rhetoric of Technopower”\n\n‘hat is (or are) the “digital humanities” (DH), also known as “humani-\nties computing”? It’s tempting to say that whoever asks the question has\n\n \n\nnot gone looking very hard for an answer. “What is digital humanities?”\nessays like this one are already genre pieces. Willard McCarty has been contribut-\ning papers on the subject for years (a monograph, too).

There have been\ndigital humanities manifestos (I know of at least two) and FAQs, colloquia and sym-\nposia, and workshops and special sessions.

It is methodological by nature and inter-\ndisciplinary in scope. It involves investigation, analysis, synthesis and presenta-\ntion of information in electronic form. It studies how these media affect the dis-\nciplines in which they are used, and what these disciplines have to contribute to\n\nour knowledge of computing.'\n\nAs a working definition this serves as well as any Pve seen, which is not surprising\nsince a glance at the page’s view history tab reveals individuals closely associated with\nthe digital humanities as contributors. At its core, then, digital humanities is more\nakin to a common methodological outlook than an investment in any one specific\nset of texts or even technologies. We could attempt to refine this outlook quantita-\ntively, using some of the very tools and techniques digital humanities has pioneered.\nFor example, we might use a text analysis tool named Voyeur developed by Stéfan\nSinclair to mine the proceedings from the annual Digital Humanities conference and\ndevelop lists of topic frequencies or collocate key terms or visualize the papers’ cita-\ntion networks.

That the major federal granting agency for scholar-\nship in the humanities, taking its cues directly from a small but active and influen-\ntial group of scholars, had devoted scarce resources to launching a number of new\ngrant opportunities, many of them programmatically innovative in and of them-\nselves, around an endeavor termed “digital humanities” was doubtless the tipping\npoint for the branding of DH, at least in the United States.\n\nThese events will, 1 think, earn a place in histories of the profession alongside\nother major critical movements like the Birmingham School or Yale deconstruction.\nIn the space of a little more than five years, digital humanities had gone from being\na term of convenience used by a group of researchers who had already been work-\ning together for years to something like a movement. Individual scholars routinely\nnow self-identify as digital humanists, or DHers. There is an unusually strong sense\nof community and common purpose manifested, for example, in events such as the\nDay of Digital Humanities, organized by a team at the University of Alberta. Its sec-\nond annual iteration featured over 150 participants (up from around one hundred\nthe first year), who blogged on a shared site about the details of their workday, posted\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:02 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Digital humanities has even been the recipient of its own Downfall remix, the\nInternet meme whereby the climactic scene from the HBO film depicting Hitler's\nfinal days in the bunker is closed captioned with, in this instance, a tirade about the\npernicious influence of online scholarship.\n\nDigital humanities was also (you may have heard) big news at the 2009 Mod-\nern Language Association (MLA) Annual Convention in Philadelphia. On Decem-\nber 28, midway through the convention, William Pannapacker, one of the Chron-\nicle of Higher Education's officially appointed bloggers, wrote the following for\nthe online “Brainstorm” section: “Amid all the doom and gloom of the 2009 MLA\nConvention, one field seems to be alive and well: the digital humanities. More than\nthat: Among all the contending subfields, the digital humanities seem like the first\n‘next big thing’ in a long time.” (It seems fair to say that Pannapacker, who is the\nauthor of “Graduate School in the Humanities: Just Don’t Go” under the pseud-\nonym Thomas Benton, is not a man easily impressed.) Jennifer Howard, mean-\nwhile, a veteran Chronicle reporter who has covered the convention before, noted\nthat the “vitality” of digital humanities drew “overflow crowds to too-small confer-\nence rooms.” There were several dozen panels devoted to the digital humanities at\nthe MLA convention, and one could (and did) easily navigate the three-day con-\nvention by moving among them.\n\nCrucially, digital humanities was visible in another way at the conference: the\nsocial networking service Twitter. Twitter is the love-it-or-hate-it Web 2.0 applica-\ntion often maligned as the final triumph of the attention-deficit generation because\nit limits postings to a mere 140 characters—not 140 words, 140 characters. The\nreason has less to do with attention spans than Twitter's origins in the messaging\nprotocols of mobile devices, but the format encourages brief, conversational posts\n(tweets) that also tend to contain a fair measure of flair and wit. Unlike Facebook,\nTwitter allows for asyrnmetrical relationships: you can “follow” someone (or they\ncan follow you) without the relationship being reciprocated. Tweeting has rapidly\nbecome an integral part of the conference scene, with a subset of attendees on Twit-\nter providing real-time running commentary through a common “tag” (#mla09,\nfor example), which allows everyone who follows it to tune in to the conversation.\nThis phenomenon has some very specific ramifications. Amanda French ran the\nnumbers and concluded that nearly half (48 percent) of attendees at the Digital\nHumanities 2009 conference were tweeting the sessions. By contrast, only 3 per-\ncent of MLA convention attendees tweeted; according to French’s data, out of about\n7,800 attendees at the MLA convention only 256 tweeted. Of these, the vast major-\nity were people already associated with digital humanities through their existing\nnetworks of followers. Jennifer Howard, again writing for the Chronicle, noted the\ncentrality of Twitter to the DH crowd and its impact on scholarly communication,\ngoing so far as to include people’s Twitter identities in her roundup of major sto-\nries from the convention. Inside Higher Ed also devoted coverage to Twitter at the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:02 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Feal was using it to connect with indi-\nvidual members of the organization——not surprisingly, many of them DHers.

Twitter, along with blogs and other online\noutlets, has inscribed the digital humanities as a network topology, that is to say\nlines drawn by aggregates of affinities, formally and functionally manifest in who\nfollows whom, who friends whom, who tweets whom, and who links to what.\nDigital humanities has also, 1 would propose, lately been galvanized by a group\nof younger (or not so young) graduate students, faculty members (both tenure\nline and contingent), and other academic professionals who now wield the label\n“digital humanities” instrumentally amid an increasingly monstrous institutional\nterrain defined by declining public support for higher education, rising tuitions,\nshrinking endowments, the proliferation of distance education and the for-profit\nuniversity, and underlying it all the conversion of full-time, tenure-track aca-\ndemic labor to a part-time adjunct workforce. One example is the remarkable\ntale of Brian Croxall, the recent Emory PhD who went viral online for a period\nof several weeks during and after the MLA convention. Croxall had his paper\n“The Absent Presence: Today’s Faculty” read at the convention in absentia while\nhe simultaneously published it on his blog after finding himself unable to afford\nto travel to Philadelphia because he hadn’t landed any convention interviews. As\nnumerous observers pointed out, Croxall’s paper, which was heavily blogged and\ntweeted and received coverage in both the Chronicle and Inside Higher Ed, was\nundoubtedly and by many orders of magnitude the most widely seen and read\npaper from the 2009 MLA convention. These events were subsequently discussed\nin a series of cross-postings and conversations that spilled across Twitter and the\nblogosphere for several weeks after the convention ended. Many seemed to feel\nthat the connection to wider academic issues was not incidental or accidental\nand that digital humanities, with a culture that values collaboration, openness,\nnonhierarchical relations, and agility, might be an instrument for real resistance\nor reform.\n\nSo what is digital humanities, and what is it doing in English departments?\nThe answer to the latter portion of the question is easier. | can think of some half a\ndozen reasons why English departments have historically been hospitable settings\nfor this kind of work. First, after numeric input, text has been by far the most trac-\ntable data type for computers to manipulate.

Even more recently, 1 would argue, the net-\nwork effects of blogs and Twitter at a moment when the academy itself is facing\nmassive and often wrenching changes linked to both new technologies and the\nchanging political and economic landscape have led to the construction of “digi-\ntal humanities” as a free-floating signifier, one that increasingly serves to focus the\nanxiety and even outrage of individual scholars over their own lack of agency amid\n\nthe turmoil in their institutions and\nsity of debates around open-access pu\n\nprofession.

It wears its disciplinary bias\non its sleeve. While I would happily acknowledge that there have been other important\nsettings in the story of the development and maturation of digital humanities, includ-\ning history, linguistics, and composition and rhetoric (when these last are separate pro-\ngrams or departments not subsumed by English), not to mention nondepartmental ven-\nues such as libraries and academic computing centers, | remain comfortable with the idea\nthat departments of English language and literature were predominant; the reasons why\nare given hereafter. (And while much has been made of the “arrival” of DH at #mla09 and\n#milall, in fact humanities computing panels have been a staple of the annual MLA con-\nvention since the early 1990s, as a scan of past years’ programs will confirm.) So this piece,\nwhich has already enjoyed a fair amount of online circulation and comment, can perhaps\nbest be taken not as the canonical account of what digital humanities is (Patrik Svensson\nin particular has done the real spadework here) but as an artifact of a particular perspec-\ntive from someone who witnessed firsthand the emergence of digital humanities from the\nvantage point of several large departments of English at public research universities in the\nUnited States. A more specific argument about DH~~the edges of which can already be\ndiscerned here—is picked up in my contribution later in this collection.\n\n1.

Especially by contrast\nwith “new media studies,” whose provocateur artists, net critics, tactical media\ntheorists, hacktivists, and so on, blend post-1960s media theory, poststructur-\nalist theory, and political critique into “net critique” and other kinds of digital\ncultural criticism, the digital humanities are noticeably missing in action on the\ncultural-critical scene.* While digital humanists develop tools, data, and meta-\ndata critically, therefore (e.g., debating the “ordered hierarchy of content objects”\nprinciple; disputing whether computation is best used for truth finding or, as Lisa\nSamuels and Jerome McGann put it, “deformance”; and. so on) rarely do they\nextend their critique to the full register of society, economics, politics, or culture\nHow the digital humanities advances, channels, or resists today’s great postin-\ndustrial, neoliberal, corporate, and global flows of information-cum-capital is\nthus a question rarely heard in the digital humanities associations, conferences,\njournals, and projects with which I am familiar. Not even the clichéd forms of\nsuch issues—for example, “the digital divide,” “surveillance,” “privacy, “copy-\nright,’ and so on—get much play.\n\nIt is as if, when the order comes down from the funding agencies, university\nadministrations, and other bodies mediating today’s dominant socioeconomic and\npolitical beliefs, digital humanists just concentrate on pushing the “execute” button\non projects that amass the most data for the greatest number, process that data most\nefficiently and flexibly (flexible efficiency being the hallmark of postindustrialism),\nand manage the whole through ever “smarter” standards, protocols, schema, tem-\nplates, and databases uplifting Frederick Winslow Taylor’s original scientific indus-\ntrialism into ultraflexible postindustrial content management systems camouflaged\nas digital editions, libraries, and archives—all without pausing to reflect on the rela-\ntion of the whole digital juggernaut to the new world order.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 01 Nov 2020 18:57:07 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 491\n\f"

Even if a distinctively new decentralized. and bot-\ntom-up ideology inspired Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, for instance, to cele-\nbrate wolf packs, Mongol hordes, and schizos quite different from the nineteenth-\ncentury Geist, it seemed clear that humanity was congenitally structural, epistemic,\nclass based, identity-group based (gendered, racial, ethnic), and so on. Currently,\ndistant reading is a catch-all for that. Indeed, the method is a catch-all for cultural-\ncritical methods extending back even earlier than May 1968 to some of the main\ninfluences on the work of Franco Moretti (the leading practitioner and theorist of\ndistant reading): Braudelian (Annales) historiography and Marxist literary sociol-\nogy, which—mixed into New Criticism and genre theory (the latter descending,\nfor example, from Western Marxist criticism in Georg Lukacs’s mode)—generate\nMoretti’s powerful thesis of the social “force” of “forms.”®\n\nNow enter the digital humanities, which have been invited to the main table\nof debate.

In reality, we recall, the running battle between the New Criti-\ncism and critical methods aprés 1968 fairly quickly settled into a cold war. Genera-\ntion ‘68, including cultural critics, occupied the high ground of “theory.” The New\nCriticism, meanwhile, dug into the ordinary, pedagogical, and even existential levels\nof reading practice—to the extent that even high theorists took pride in ground-\ning their method in close reading.

We imagine, after all, that even\nas bolda distant reader as Moretti still at times—or even most times——wants to pause\nto close read en bloc literary passages as he encounters them. But block quotations\nhave a different status in the digital humanities. Either they drop out of perception\nentirely because text analysis focuses on microlevel linguistic features (e.g., word fre-\nquencies) that map directly over macrolevel phenomena (e.g., different genres or\nnationalities of novels) without need for the middle level of quoted passages; or they\nexist as what hypertext theorists, originally inspired by Roland Barthes, call “lexia”—\nthat is, modular chunks in a larger network where the real interest inheres in the\nglobal pattern of the network.” In either case, one noticeable effect of distant read-\ning in Moretti and Jockers’s mode is that data visualizations of large patterns increas-\ningly replace block quotations as the objects of sustained focus. One now close reads\ngraphs and diagrams that have roughly the same cognitive weight (and even visual\nsize on the page) as block quotations of old, even if the mode of “meaningfulness”\nto be read off such visualizations is of a different order (linking the act of analysis\nmore to breadth of field than to a sense of depth or emplacement).\n\nThe upshot is that digital humanists will never get a better invite to the table,\nas I put it, where the mainstream humanities are renegotiating the relation between\nqualitative methods premised on a high quotient of tacit understanding and quan-\ntitative methods requiring a different rigor of programmatic understanding. All\nthose lonely decades of work on text encoding, text analysis, digital archives or\neditions, online reading tools or environments, and other incunabula of digital\nscholarship are now not so lonely. Mainstream humanists have come to recognize\nthat, at minimum, they need a search function to do research; and the nature of\ndigital media is such that the transition from the minimum to the maximum is\nalmost instantaneous. No sooner does one come to depend on online searching\nthen it becomes intuitive that one also needs advanced digital humanities tools and\nresources to practice scholarship in the age of Google Books.

Or, as in the\npast, will they once more be merely servants at the table whose practice is perceived\nto be purely instrumental to the main work of the humanities?'? This is the block-\nage in the growth of the field that I fear.

After\nall, it can be said that digital materials on the scale of corpora, databases, distrib-\nuted repositories, and so on—specialties of the digital humanities—are ipso facto\ncultural phenomena. The people behind Google Books Ngram Viewer say it. In\ntheir groundbreaking Science article (paralleled by Google’s release of its Ngram\nViewer), Jean-Baptiste Michel and Erez Lieberman Aiden (with their collaborators)\ncall their quantitative analyses of Google Books a contribution to “culturomics.”\nSo, too, the Software Studies Initiative at the University of California, San Diego, is\nwell advanced in developing what it calls “cultural analytics.”'* Where are the digi-\ntal humanists in the picture?

Especially in public university sys-\ntems, which are exposed most directly to changing social, economic, and political\nattitudes, the new normal threatens to solve the two cultures problem by effectively\nsubtracting one of the cultures. The humanities, arts, and other disciplines that rely\ndisproportionately on funds not supplied by industry or national agencies for sci-\nence, medicine, and defense are in peril of systematic defunding.\n\nSimultaneous with such defunding, another peril threatens the humanities: the\ncontinuing breakdown in their ability to communicate with the public. This, too,\nis an old story that extends back, for instance, to the decline of the fabled “public\nintellectual” in the twentieth century. What is new today is that the Internet and,\nmost recently, Web 2.0 have altered the very idea of effective public communica-\ntion by changing the relation between “experts,” traditionally those with something\nvaluable to communicate, and the public, who traditionally listened to expertise\n(or at least media reports about expertise) and responded with votes, tuition dol-\nlars, fees, and so on to support the various expert institutions and professions. As\nperhaps best exemplified by Wikipedia, the new networked public is now devel-\noping its own faculty of expertise through bottom-up processes of credentialing\n(e.g., Wikipedia’s “administrators”), refereeing, governance, and so on. It will take\nat least a generation for the academy (and mediating agencies such as journalism)\nto create or adapt the institutional protocols, practices, and technologies that can\nnegotiate a new compact of knowledge between expertise and networked public\nknowledge—for example, between the standards of peer review and crowdsourc-\ning. In the meantime, the humanities are caught in a particularly vicious form of\nthe communicational impasse of expertise. While the networked public still toler-\nates specialized knowledge from scientists, engineers, doctors, and others, it seems\nto have ever less patience for specialized humanities knowledge, since in the domain\nof “human” experience everyman with his blog is an autodidact. And this is not even\nto mention the ridiculous mismatch between the forms of humanities knowledge\nand the new networked public knowledge—for example, between the scale, struc-\nture, and cadence of a humanities monograph and those of a blog post or tweet.'*\n\nIn short, just when the humanities need more than ever to communicate their\nvision of humanity (and so their own value) to the public, they find themselves\nincreasingly cut off from the modes of communication that produce some of today’s\nmost robust discourses of public knowledge. While able like anyone else to reach out\nthrough the new media, humanities scholars by and large must do so as individu-\nals unsupported by any of the institutional and professional structures that afford\nthem their particular identity qua humanists or scholars.\n\nHence the unique leadership opportunity for the digital humanities.

Ata minimum, digital humanists—perhaps in alli-\nance with social scientists who study Internet social activism—might facilitate inno-\nvative uses of new media for such traditional forms of advocacy as essays, editorials,\npetitions, letter-writing campaigns, and so on. But really, digital humanists should\ncreate technologies that fundamentally reimagine humanities advocacy. The goal,\nI suggest, is to build advocacy into the ordinary work of the humanities, so that\nresearch and teaching organically generate advocacy in the form of publicly mean-\ningful representations of the humanities. As a starting point, for example, consider\nhow something like the Open Journal Systems (OJS) publication platform might be\nextended for this purpose. Created by the Public Knowledge Project, OJS facilitates\nthe publication and management of online journals while also providing “reading\ntools” that assist users in pursuing additional research (e.g., looking beyond an indi-\nvidual text through search and aggregation tools that give a glimpse of the relevant\ncontext). Imagine that OJS could be mashed up with text analysis and extraction\ntools as well as output platforms like OMEKA or the Simile Exhibit and Timeline\nwidgets designed to break scholarship free of the “document” format, with the result\nthat the publication process automatically generates from every article a “capture”\nof humanities scholarship that is not just an abstract but something more akin to a\nbrochure, poster, video, or other high-impact brief—that is, something that could\nexpose the gist of scholarship for public view and use.\n\nThe idea is to create ways to allow humanities scholars deliberately, spontane-\nously, or collaboratively to generate a bow wave of public awareness about their\nresearch and teaching that propagates outward as part of the natural process of\nresearch and teaching. After all, millions tune in each week to watch crab fisher-\nmen on the Discovery Channel (Deadliest Catch). Humanists may not be salt-of-\nthe-earth crabbers, and archives may not be as stormy as the high seas. But surely,\nhumanists ought on occasion to try to share the excitement of the chase by which\nbreakthrough intellectual discoveries and movements occur. A beautifully designed,\nvisually rich report published by the United Kingdom’s JISC (Joint Information\nSystems Committee) in 2010 titled “Inspiring Research, Inspiring Scholarship: The\nValue and Benefits of Digitised Resources for Learning, Teaching, Research and\nEnjoyment” gives the flavor of what I mean (Tanner).

If you are not making anything, you are\nnot... a digital humanist” (“Who’s In and Who’s Out”; see also his follow-up post\n“On Building”).\n\nBut now I will widen the context. The insecurity of the digital humanities about\ninstrumentalism, we should realize, simply shifts to a new register a worry expe-\nrienced by the humanities at large. On the one hand, the humanities also struggle\nagainst the perception that they are primarily instrumental because their assigned\nrole is to provide students with a skill set needed for future life and work. For\nexample, the rhetoric of university course catalogs (which speak of the humanities\nas providers of “skills” in critical analysis, language, and so on) combines with the\ninsidious logic of higher teaching loads for humanists to imply that the main func-\ntion of the humanities is service: they teach the analytical, communicational, and\nother abilities needed as means to other ends. In truth, it may be that no matter how\nmuch the humanities try to position themselves as research or ethical pursuits in\ntheir own right, they will find it hard to break out of the instrumentalist syndrome\nsimply because, by comparison with the STEM (and, to a lesser extent, social sci-\nence) fields, they are identified almost entirely with the academy itself as a means\nof student preparation. There are relatively few extra~academic research labs, think\ntanks, clinics, and so on able to give a home to the humanities in autonomous or\nadvanced, rather than preparatory, social roles.\n\nOn the other hand, clearly, the humanities suffer even more from seeming to\nbe noninstrumental to the point of uselessness. In hard economic times (a real-life\nincident from my own experience), parents actually come up to chairs of English\ndepartments at graduation to complain that their daughter’s humanities degree is\nonly good for working at Starbucks.!” The catch-22 is that the harder the humani-\nties work to become research enterprises equipping students with specialized com-\npetencies and vocabularies, the more cut off they seem from practical use. This\nis particularly galling for post~May 1968 cultural critics, who addressed their\nadvanced research methods to praxis but, if anything, reinforced the impression\nthat humanist critique is only interpretive, reflective, politically marginal, skeptical,\nor nihilist—that is, unrealpolitik.'’ Much of my own early work in cultural criti-\ncism (and also as an internal critic of the method) was devoted to exploring this and\nrelated problems—for example, in the essays on subversion collected in my Local\nTranscendence: Essays on Postmodern Historicism and the Database.

A compelling recent\nexample is the idea of corporate culture in the United States, which emerged after\nthe 1970s in conjunction with the expansion of the so-called. service industries,\nespecially in the areas of “knowledge work.” In the new service industries, men and\nwomen were imprisoned by global socioeconomic forces in little cubicles staring\nat even smaller cells in a spreadsheet. Corporate culture was an expression of that,\nsince the idea was that strong corporations have totalizing cultures that determine\n(and are constantly reinforced by) everything from information technology prac-\ntices to company slogans and social events. Yet paradoxically, corporate culture was\nalso supposed to incubate in workers the spirit of “disruptive” innovation and entre-\npreneurship that is the mark of neoliberal freedom.” It’s as if we all live in the uni-\nverse of Iain M. Banks’s richly imagined science fiction novels set in the universe of\n“the Culture,” a sprawling galactic civilization that dominates in a totally distrib-\nuted, decentralized, Western-liberal style at once wholly determinative and utterly\nlaissez-faire in its encouragement of individual freedom.”\n\nMy conclusion—or, perhaps, just a hopeful guess—is that the appropriate,\nunique contribution that the digital humanities can make to cultural criticism at\nthe present time is to use the tools, paradigms, and. concepts of digital technologies\nto help rethink the idea of instrumentality. The goal, as I put it earlier, is to think\n“critically about metadata” (and everything else related to digital technologies) in a\nway that “scales into thinking critically about the power, finance, and other gover-\nnance protocols of the world” Phrased even more expansively, the goal is to rethink\ninstrumentality so that it includes both humanistic and STEM fields in a culturally\nbroad, and not just narrowly purposive, ideal of service.\n\nIn particular, my recommendation for the digital humanities is two-fold: First,\nwhile continuing to concentrate on research and development in its core areas (¢.g.,\ntext encoding, text analysis, pattern discovery, the creation of digital archives and\nresources), digital humanists should enter into fuller dialogue with the adjacent\nfields of new media studies and media archaeology so as to extend reflection on\ncore instrumental technologies in cultural and historical directions. The time is\nlong overdue for staging major conferences or programs designed specifically to put\ndigital humanists in the same room, for example, with new media artists, hackers,\nand media theorists. In that room, standard issues in the digital humanities (such\nas “standards” themselves) could be enlarged with sociocultural meaning. Individ-\nuals working in the digital humanities, or who straddle fields, already increasingly\nengage in such dialogue. What is needed now is the elevation of the dialogue to the\nfront and center of the discipline of the digital humanities.\n\nSecond, digital humanists should also enter into dialogue with science-\ntechnology studies. On reflection, it is remarkable how little the field draws on con-\ntemporary science-technology studies to enrich its discussion of tools, building, and\ninstrumentality through new understandings of the way researchers, technicians,\nprocesses, communication media, and literal instruments come together in what\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 01 Nov 2020 18:57:07 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 501\n\f"

Science-technology studies by Lorraine Daston, Peter Galison, and\nBruno Latour, for example, are canonical in this respect——for example, Daston and\nGalison’s work on the history of changing ideals of “objectivity” (variously mediated\nby instruments and interpreters) and Latour’s well-known melding of the concepts\nof human agency and machine instrumentality in “actor-network theory.’ Engag-\ning with science-technology studies would help the digital humanities develop an\nunderstanding of instrumentalism—including that of its own methods—as a cul-\nture embedded in wider culture.”\n\nSteps like these would give digital humanists a more solid foundation or, better,\na heretofore missing technological and intellectual infrastructure (by analogy with\nmodern programming, which evolved infrastructural software layers to mediate\nbetween low-level resources and high-level applications) through which to grapple\nwith cultural issues.” Only by creating a methodological infrastructure in which\nculturally aware technology complements technologically aware cultural criticism\ncan the digital humanities more effectively serve humanists by augmenting their\nability to engage today’s global-scale cultural issues.\n\nUltimately, the greatest service that the digital humanities can contribute to the\nhumanities is to practice instrumentalism in a way that demonstrates the neces-\nsity of breaking down the artificial divide of the “two cultures” to show that the\nhumanities are needed alongside the sciences to solve the intricately interwoven nat-\nural, technological, economic, social, political, and cultural problems of the global\nage. For example, there is not a single “grand challenge” announced by the Obama\nAdministration, the Grand Challenges in Global Health initiative, the U.S. National\nAcademy of Engineering, and other agencies or foundations in the areas of energy,\nenvironment, biomedicine, food, water, education, and so on that does not require\nhumanistic involvement.” All these issues have a necessary cultural dimension,\nwhether as cause or effect; and ail, therefore, need the public service of humanist\nand, increasingly, digital humanist participants.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis chapter is a substantially extended version of a brief paper by the same title that I orig-\ninally presented in truncated form at the Modern Language Association convention in 2011\nand subsequently posted online (Liu, “Where Is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humani-\nties?”).

The Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR) started in the Sili-\ncon Valley area in 1981 to express concern over the military use of computer systems and\nlater broadened its scope to other social justice concerns related to computing.

This is a simplification, of course. A more extended discussion would note that\nmuch of the latent cultural-critical interest of the digital humanities lay under the sur-\nface in textual-editing theory, hypertext theory, and other registers of method specialized\naround the idea of textuality. In this regard, Jerome McGann’s A Critique of Modern Tex-\ntual Criticism and. “The Rationale of Hypertext” (e.g., the coda on “the decentered text”)\nare of a piece with cultural criticism in the post-May 1968 era, as is Matthew Kirschen-\nbaum’s invocation of D. E McKenzie’s Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts to discuss the\n“complex network of individuals, communities, ideologies, markets, technologies, and\nmotivations” that inform the task of preserving digital media with “a pronounced social\ndimension that is at least as important as purely technical considerations” (Kirschen-\nbaum, 240-41). “Net Critique” is the title of the blog of the network theorist and critic\nGeert Lovink. The phrase is also aptly generic for cultural criticism of the digital age.\n\n5. Susan Schreibman discusses the debate over the “ordered hierarchy of content\nobjects” (OHCO) thesis engaged in most famously by Allan Renear and Jerome McGann\n(e.g., in the latter’s “Rethinking Textuality”). On the deformance thesis, see Samuels and\nMcGann.\n\n6.

However, I am aware that this has a somewhat distorting effect because the under-\nlying issue of quantitative versus qualitative methods is older in other humanities fields\nand. social science disciplines, with the result that recent digital technologies enter into\nplay in those fields in a different methodological context. In historiography, for instance,\nthe Annales movement brought distant reading and quantitative methods to the fore in\nthe mid-twentieth century. One difference in the contemporary history field, therefore,\nis that the front line of recent digital history concerns such methods as geographic infor-\nmation systems (GIS) or social-network analysis that evolve quantitative methods further\nor differently (rather than redebate the first principles of the quantitative approach).

I discuss the origin of the New Criticism in Liu, “Close, Distant, and Unexpected\nReading.”\n9. See, for example, Moretti’s reflections on “form” as a “diagram of forces” (Graphs,\nMaps, Trees, 56~57, 64).\n10. Hayles, 63~64, gives other examples of high theorists and critics claiming alle-\ngiance to close reading. On the New Historicist “anecdote,” see my discussions in Local\nTranscendence (¢.g., 23-24, 29-30, 258-61).\n11. See Allison et al. (including Jockers and Moretti) on “the Great Unread—the vast,\nunexplored archive that lies underneath the narrow canon of literary history” (10).\n12. For “lexia” in hypertext theory, see Landow’s influential adaptation of Barthes’s\nterm (4).\n13. Julia Flanders nicely captures the stigma of servitude that has marked the digi-\n\ntal humanities when she writes, “Representational technologies like XML, or databases,\n\n \n\nor digital visualization tools appear to stand apart from the humanities research activ-\nities they support. .. . Humanities scholarship has historically understood this separ-\nateness as indicating an ancillary role—that of the handmaiden, the good servant/poor\n\nmister.\n\n \n\nin which humanities insight masters and subsumes what these technologies can\noffer” (para. 11).\n\n14. One of the main emphases in the article on culturomics by Michel and Lieberman\nAiden et al. is that the study of language enabled by their ngram analysis of Google Books\nfacilitates the study of culture generaily. Some of their specific examples (such as censor-\nship of names of intellectuals in Nazi Germany) are closely analogous to humanities cul-\ntural criticism (181). Similarly, specific projects in “cultural analytics” at the University of\nCalifornia San Diego Software Studies Initiative include not just those that define culture\nin terms of aesthetic or media artifacts but also those that use the initiative’s methods to\nstudy culture in a recognizably cultural-critical sense—e.g., projects on “2008 U.S. presi-\ndential campaign ads”; “visualizing art, industry, territory, and global econonny in Brazil”;\nor “mapping 28 years of TV news” (Software Studies Initiative, “Projects”).\n\n15. To be fair, society’s ever narrower focus on applied research threatens the STEM\nfields themselves, causing scientists to worry ever more about how to argue for the need for\nbasic research. During 2009-2010, I led a subgroup (on research mission and principles)\n\nion on\n\n \n\nfor the research strategies working group of the University of California Commis\nthe Future (UCOE, a body convened by the regents of the university to rethink the para-\ndigm of the University of California in the face of systemic, long-term cuts in state fund-\ning).

While only a part of the recommendations of the various working groups made\nit into the UCOP’s Final Report, that report does contain the following defensive language\nabout basic research: “It is also critical that federal support for research be sustained or even\nincreased given that the federal government underwrites so much of the basic research\nconducted at U.S. research universities, laboratories and research organizations. Although\nthe President’s budget calls for a steady increase in the financing of research, due to pres~\nsure to reduce federal budgets, Congress may look for short-term monetary gains and\nneglect basic research and its long-term impact on economic health” (24).\n\n16. The academic use of social networking, blogs, and a variety of experimental plat-\nforms such as CommentPress (a blog-like platform capable of presenting monographs in\nmodular paragraph units each of which can be commented on by users) attests that the\nadoption of the new protocols, practices, technologies, and forms in the academy is under-\nway. But, as I mention later, there is a difference between scholars using such methods on\nan individual or ad hoc basis and using them in an institutional framework, which so far\n\ndoes not exist to integrate or, in many cases, even support the new comniunication media.\n\n \n\n(For a description of CommentPress, see Knight; and Hovey and Hudson.)\n17.

See Alex Reid’s response to my short paper on which this\n\n \n\nsay is originally based.\nAmong other excellent commentary, Reid reflects, “1 don’t think it is unreasonable to argue\nthat cultural critique as it has developed over the past 30-40 years has been a contributing\n\nfactor to the general cultural decline of the humaniti\n\n \n\ns. At the very least, with historical\nhindsight, it was not the change that we needed if our intention was to remain culturally\nrelevant. ... Cultural critique has led us to be overspecialized, largely irrelevant, and barely\nintelligible, even to one another, let alone to the broader society.

He writes that “to understand the\ncontemporary born-digital culture and the everyday practices that populate it... we need\na corresponding focus on the computer code that is entangled with all aspects of our lives,\nincluding reflexivity about how much code is infiltrating the academy itself” (4). This\nmeans problematizing “the unspoken assumptions and ontological foundations which\nsupport the ‘normal’ research that humanities scholars undertake on an everyday basis”\n(4) and recognizing that “there is an undeniable cultural dimension to computation and\nthe media affordances of software” (5).

In her recruitment effort, she describes HASTAC as a “voluntary\nnetwork” of scholars whose work reaches beyond academia to expand what the\ndigital humanities could and should be. In doing so, Davidson defines HASTAC’s\nsphere of influence in moral and ethical terms:\n\nIt’s not only “digital humanities” in the traditional sense (although the impres-\nsive and creative work happening in digital humanities is certainly one part of\nHASTAC) but it is “humanities” in the even more traditional sense of concern for\nthe deep issues of humanity and society (including the role of science and tech-\nnology and the state of our planet) that structure everything else in our world,\nissues of equity and ethics and humanity, issues of what it means to be human\n(on a deep level informed by science as well as morality), issues of learning and\nhistory and introspection, issues of culture, multiculturalism, community, com-\nmunication, and interaction.\n\nAlthough Davidson argues that this form of humanities is doubly “traditional,”\nshe also seems to be describing a kind of “hybrid humanities” of the kind praised\nby Patrik Svennson as “visionary” by virtue of “being situated at the periphery and\nfighting established structures” (“A Visionary Scope”).\n\nDavidson concludes her posting with a very different kind of call to action\nfrom her initial help-wanted message, one that speaks directly to hackers who might\nwant to topple the theocratic Iranian regime that had just crushed prodemocracy\nprotests contesting recent election results and had. shut down the microblogging\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n{161\n\f"

Davidson alerts her audience that Western digital rights advocates had\n“received an SOS from pro-democracy activists in Tehran asking us all to use basic\nhacking tools to flood the propaganda sites of the ruling regime with junk traffic in\norder to bring them down and thereby open Twitter channels again.” Accordingly\nshe reposts the following orders for electronic civil disobedience from Boing Boing,\nthe popular “directory of wonderful things”: “NOTE to HACKERS—attack www\nfarhang.gov.ir—pls try to hack all iran gov wesites [sic]. very difficult for us,? Tweets\none activist. The impact of these distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks isn?t\nclear.

What is the connection between Davidson’s elo-\nquent defense of a broader notion of the digital humanities and her reposting of a\nrushed message that is peppered with misspellings, abbreviations, fragments, and\nungrammatical infelicities of style? Davidson appears to be again positioning the\ndigital humanities as a site of political activism, one that can run the gamut from\nthe institutionally conventional to the radicalized and marginalized, recognizable\nas being in the tradition of campus protests about subjects such as civil rights or\nantimilitarism that have defined how political commitment and dissent are staged\nin the built environment of the university while also being part of a new vanguard\nof networked digital culture in which protests in the temporary autonomous zones\nof computational media are rhizomatic, sporadic, and even ironic in the rhetorical\nstances that they adopt.\n\nDavidson’s use of the trope of “drinking the Kool-Aid” seems to allude to cri-\ntiques of blind obedience or collective hallucination commonly deployed by crit-\nics of cyberutopianism and its associated narratives of technoprogress and Inter-\nnet liberation theology. Specifically Davidson writes that her program coordinator\ndoesn’t “have to drink the HASTAC Kool-Aid” but does “have to be willing to work\nreally hard to support the HASTAC mission and to respect those who believe in it”\nIn doing so, Davidson emphasizes a work ethic very much like the one described\nin Pekka Himanen’s The Hacker Ethic, which mixes devotion to the spirit of infor-\nmationalism with a set of highly intensive labor practices that link individuals to\ncollectives.\n\nBy urging her readership to participate in distributed denial of service attacks\naimed at the government of Iran, Davidson also links HASTAC with another frame\nof cultural reference, that of hacktivism, or the writing of code to promote or subvert\nparticular political ideologies. In addition to protesting human rights violations, in\nthe recent past hacktivists have used their programming skills as a form of civil dis-\nobedience to promote free and open software, privacy, free speech, freedom of move-\nment, governmental transparency, information ethics, political self-determination,\nenvironmental protection, and a range of other online and offline causes.

However, because hacking tends\nto be a kind of virtuoso performance by seasoned programmers, the ability to wield\ntools that expose vulnerabilities in security, privacy, or accurate data representa-\ntion is often seen as the sole purview of an elite group of highly computer-literate\ncognoscenti very different from the print-cultured college professors and graduate\nstudents who might be expected to read Davidson’s blog.\n\nIn thinking about the relationship between hacktivism and the humanities,\nthis essay attempts to describe a range of related protest movements during a time\nin which there is a significant cohort of professors calling for hacking the academy\nthat includes department chairs, heads of national centers, and those in the leader-\nship of professional associations who are demanding fundamental changes in fair\nuse, peer review, and tenure guidelines. There are also others who are going even\nfurther and rejecting their allegiances to traditional forms of university governance\nand risking tenure and even arrest by engaging in direct confrontation on a range\nof political issues through electronic civil disobedience. To understand these phe-\nnomena that bring either politics into academia or academia into politics, I argue\nthat it is helpful to examine current theories both of hacking and of hacktivism,\nor the nonviolent use of digital tools in pursuit of political ends, and. to consider\nhow dissent by students and faculty and protest by an old guard of political orga-\nnizers and a new cadre of programmers in the general public may be related. In the\ncontext of the digital humanities, hacktivism theory offers a way to broaden and\ndeepen our understanding of the use of digital tools and of the politics of that tool\nuse and to question the uncritical instrumentalism that so many digital humani-\nties projects propound.\n\nDigital Dissent\n\nSome might argue that Davidson’s appeal for hackers to bring down Iranian gov-\nernment sites shows a profoundly naive understanding of how human rights dis-\ncourses function in the era of the Internet. In practical terms, such denial of service\nattacks on state-run online media may only intensify suspicions that outside agi-\ntators are interfering with the internal politics of a country with a long history of\nunwelcome U.S. intervention and covert warfare. Furthermore, such attacks on the\nstate’s propaganda infrastructure do little to protect the lives of human rights activ-\nists who document state violence against women, police brutality, summary execu-\ntion, unauthorized detention, or other brutal forms of state control. Such activists\nbear witness when they post online video or publicize abuses on blogs and micro-\nblogging sites through channels independent of the information mechanisms of\nthe authoritarian state, providing evidence with persuasive power rather than just\ndisruption of an online user’s experience (Gregory). Older broadcast or telephonic\ntechnologies may also provide useful models for a more effective form of hacktivism\nthat respects existing culture and facilitates practical change.

Other critics of Davidson might observe that the time of digital human-\nists might be better invested in creating a good information visualization that shows\nthe statistical features of the election irregularities that drove many into the street,\nwhich might have more persuasive power than a vandalized government website,\nalthough it lacks the glamour of radical chic.\n\nCertainly, not all who use software for political dissent agree that hacktivism\nand scholarly research are natural partners. New York University’s Alexander Gallo-\nway, who directs the Radical Software Group, appears wary of uncritically accepting\nany ideology that affirms that distributed networks are inherently liberatory. In The\nExploit: A Theory of Networks, Galloway and Eugene Thacker describe the Inter-\nnet as both highly centralized and highly dispersed in structure and a platform for\nboth corporate and subversive activity. In their account of network relations, the\nbroadcast and surveillance mechanisms of hidden power brokers and the cracking\nof hackers who undermine authority covertly and idiosyncratically might not be so\ndifferent, after all. Although Galloway’s team is probably capable of infiltrating and\ndisrupting some seemingly secure networks, he also implies that simply hacking\nthose networks does little to foster meaningful intellectual exploration. Instead. he\naspires to create a new framework for critical theory to help others with “thinking\ntopologically” (Galloway, 13) about forms of networked organization very differ-\nent from hierarchical pyramids. For Galloway and Thacker, the fundamental con-\nstraints of protocol politics are of much more interest than the romantic myths of\n\n \n\nlone antiheroes. Lronically, they argue that hacktivism actually operates within the\ncontext of a “new syrametry” that places electronic civil disobedience in a static geo-\nmetrical relationship with “cyberwar,’ which is also similar to other forms of “net-\nwar” that do little to foster the kind of serious systematic critique that is the subject\nof their book (Galloway, 66). Indeed, while DDOS attacks were used recently to pro-\ntest the international pursuit of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, such attacks have\n\n \n\nalso been part of the defense mechanisms of more conventional forms of nation-\nstate militarism complete with geographical borders and definitions of citizenship\nconstituted by ideologies of self-determination and shared ethnicity from Estonia\nto East Timor.!\n\nGalloway, however, makes a significant exception for academic hacktivists like\nhimself, as he explains the aims of the Radical Software Group and subversive proj-\nects like Carnivore, which mocks an FBI surveillance system of the same name that\nwas designed to monitor e-mail and other forms of electronic communication ona\nmassive scale: “You might call RSG a hacker rip-off group. For example, Carnivore\nis nothing but a new spin on the packet sniffer, a tool that hackers and sys admins\nhave been using for years.

(Of course I’m referring to traditional\nhackers, not hacktivists like Critical Art Ensemble or The Yes Men.) So one of the\ngoals of RSG is to bring a more political and theoretical awareness to hacker prac-\ntice” (Quaranta). The Carnivore project website explains that “Galloway’s artwork is\nindependent of the federal digital-surveillance program, yet it functions in much the\nsame way,’ although “he takes his data from volunteers,’ and “his program generates\nart” not “incriminating evidence,” because rather than “sifting the flow of data—\nwhich might include personal, potentially sensitive material like Web-page con-\ntents and chat-session exchanges—in a quest for clues,” the software “converts the\nelectronic information into vibrant images and sounds” (Radical Software Group).\n\nIn response to the Iranian postelection situation, some digital humanities proj-\nects took a fundamentally different approach from either the anonymous cyberat-\ntacks promoted by Davidson or the kind of artistic translation, conversion, and reap-\npropriation at work in Galloway’s projects that subverts signification and coherence.\nHyperCities, a digital humanities initiative that describes itself as “a digital research\nand. educational platform for exploring, learning about, and interacting with the\nlayered histories of city and global spaces,” supported the efforts of UCLA Iranian-\nAmerican graduate student Xarene Eskandar to create a collection of geotagged\nsocial media artifacts that document the election protests in Iran with markers on\nelectronic maps, online videos, links to microblog postings, and explanations of the\nsignificance of a range of digital ephemera by Eskandar, who wrote,\n\nWorking against Iranian state media censorship, 1 wanted to keep track of the\nprotests across the country and especially the capital, Tehran, to show they are\nnot isolated events. My goal is to raise awareness of the magnitude of discontent,\nas well as keep a record of it due to the temporal nature of Twitter. State media\neither denied there were any protests, or they circulated false news that the unrest\nwas only in northern Tehran, a well-to-do part of the city (and sympathetic to\nWestern culture), and a few times they even claimed the opposition to be pro-\n\ngovernment while broadcasting the protests with no audio. They also claimed\n\n \n\nall other provinces were calm, while in fact the protests were not limited to class,\n\nage or province and were wide-spread. (Presner)\n\nIn other words, in the terms of modern information theory, Eskandar describes her\ngoals as facilitating signal rather than noise to spread information about the location\nand recurrence of protest activities rather than jam the systems of their oppressors.\n\nMore recently, the HyperCities group in the UCLA Digital Humanities Col-\nlaborative created HyperCities Egypt. Subtitled “Voices from Cairo through Social\nMedia, it includes a Google map of Egypt’s capital that reorients the viewer as the\nprogram pinpoints a new tweet every four seconds that includes hashtags associ-\nated with the street protests that toppled the Mubarak government, such as #Jan25\nor #egypt. “Because it gathers tweets from those who have enabled Twitter's ‘add\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 165\n\f"

Thus multiple systems of authen-\ntication function sirmultancously in the HyperCities spectacle of transparency; on-\nscreen text is tied both to images of the urban landscape that can be zoomed in on\nfrom a satellite view and to photographs of the faces of those who bear witness.\n\nHyperCities director Todd Presner maintains that this retasking of a digital\nhumanities mapping tool designed to teach about urban history in sites such as\nancient Rome or Weimar Berlin is completely consistent with the project’s mission,\nbecause “HyperCities Egypt gives users a sense of living—and reliving—history”\n(Presner). The software also maps contemporary protests to share information\nabout rapidly unfolding events organized by smart mobs with potential future par-\nticipants. Presner, Eskandar, and others in HyperCities see this kind of dissemina-\ntion of real-time data as continuing the scholarly work of building digital archives.\n\nHowever, this form of digital humanities also borrows from contemporary\nactivist practices that use digital mapping technologies in grassroots organizing and\nthe human rights work of NGOs. One might argue that HyperCities Egypt and the\nHyperCities Tehran collections are actually much more like the mapping initiatives\njointly sponsored by Google Earth and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, Cri-\nsis in Darfur and World is Witness, which use aerial digital photography and online\ncrowd sourcing in African nations like Sudan, Rwanda, and the Democratic Repub-\nlic of Congo, as well as in Bosnia~Herzegovina and Chechnya, to track both evi-\ndence of past crimes against humanity and present genocides potentially unfolding.\n\nThus these uses of testimony and evidence put the digital humanities in dia-\nlogue with movements for decriminalization and political abolitionism and open\nup new forms of electronic publication for scholars who see themselves as poten-\ntial agents of change. For example, Sharon Daniel’s Public Secrets and Blood Sugar\nwebsites, which use digital audio recordings of prisoners and drug addicts, were cre-\nated with programming resources from the online journal Vectors and thus partially\nfunded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). Yet many NEH\ndigital humanities competitions specifically forbid endorsing any particular politi-\ncal point of view and would seem to promote a form of technocratic neutrality very\ndifferent from the work of the most interesting practitioners in the field.\n\nElectronic Civil Disobedience\n\nOutright electronic civil disobedience could be described as the most militant form\nof political resistance in the digital humanities and one that has become more vis-\nible in panels and professional associations in recent years. Many scholars date theo-\nries of electronic civil disobedience in the academy to the early work of Critical Art\nEnsemble (CAE) on the subject.

While\nexercising this freedom, faculty must also abide by the Faculty Code of Conduct\nlocated in Section E of AMP-015, which addresses interaction with the commu-\nnity and defines two types of unacceptable conduct: 1) intentional misrepresen-\ntation of personal views as a statement of position of the University or any of its\nagencies; and, 2) commission of a criminal act which has led to conviction in a\ncourt of law and which clearly demonstrated unfitness to continue as a member\n\nof the faculty. (“Use of Resources”)\n\nAlthough Dominguez was eventually cleared of culpability and both types of “unac-\nceptable conduct” were eventually ruled out as possibilities, these categories point\nto how certain online activities create slippage in delineating the difference between\n“personal views” and professional expertise and also raise questions about what con-\nstitutes a “criminal act” when computer algorithms perform their unit operations\nautomatically and highly efficient digital distribution systems produce cascading\neffects not possible to execute from a single computer.\n\nOf course, the figure of the protesting professor is a familiar one on college\ncampuses, and many sympathetic faculty members rallied to Dominguez’s side as\nhe grappled with the mounting costs of legal assistance from multiple lawyers as he\nwas faced with defending himself in a complex case involving many legal and pro-\ncedural issues within the jurisdiction of federal, state, local, and campus authori-\nties and specific technologies that had never before been litigated or regulated (Prof.\nRicardo Dominguez). In addition to fundraising efforts, letters of support were soon\nposted on websites and Facebook pages and disseminated via listservs and e-mail.\nOne letter from the “Faculty Coalition” emphasized appeals to authority, the litmus\ntests of peer review, and the stature of Dominguez as a “defining figure in the migra-\ntion of performance art from physical space to virtual space”; it also pointed out the\nirony that Dominguez was being persecuted for precisely what he received tenure\nfor (UCSD Coalition Letter).

It is our mandate as\neducators to explore these points of tension and reconciliation in our research\nand our teaching. Clearly we are living through a period of profound technologi-\ncal change. It is in the nature of such moments that these changes also transform\nour understanding of culture and politics, introducing new concepts of public\nidentity and space, and new modes of political action and cultural expression.\nThis is precisely the task that Professor Dominguez has taken on in his research.\nIf UCSD is to retain its international reputation for excellence it’s essential that\nthe principles of academic and artistic freedom be defended against the grow-\ning pressures exerted by incipient privatization and political extremism. (Visual\n\nArts Letter of Support for Ricardo Dominguez)\n\nThe ideal of the public intellectual could be said to be at the core of many argu-\nments for bringing more hacktivists into the digital humanities. Hacktivism brings\nuniversity scholarship into the headlines and makes it possible to articulate argu-\nments about the relevance of the digital humanities that go beyond cultural heri-\ntage claims that rarely get much public attention. Despite the dismay of university\nadministrators, who are often hesitant to recognize computer programming as a\nform of campus free speech, faculty and students continue to deploy code to further\nactivist agendas. Yet media reports about hacktivist conduct by faculty, graduate stu-\ndents, and. undergraduates rarely place these computer-coded expressions of pro-\ntest in the context of other kinds of campus activism or critical engagement (Losh,\nVirtualpolitik, 199-238). Whether a scholarly researcher is generating electronic\nboarding passes to protest homeland security policies or using data-mining tech-\nniques to identify self-interested. Wikipedia edits by corporations and politicians,\nthe attention goes to the programmer’s identity as a hacker, rather than as a member\nof the academy, even though such conduct may be both socially useful and morally\njustified and thus fully in keeping with the university’s mission to serve the public.\n\nCritical Information Studies\n\nThe digital ephemera created by Dominguez’s hacktivism have also become objects\nof study in the humanities. However, as scholars work collectively to interpret varied\npractices that include the “political coding” and “performative hacking” that bring\ntogether the efforts of hacker-programmers and artist-activists from the postmod-\nern left (Samuelson), it may be more accurate to describe this research as “hybrid\nhumanities” rather than “digital humanities,” because those doing it often are study-\ning art practices, conducting field work, or emulating code rather than merely\nexplicating textual artifacts in a narrow interpretation of the tradition of humani-\nties scholarship. Some literary scholars who are drawn to Dominguez’s work have\napproached it as a hypertext in which “a multi-layered networked narrative” links\nto evidence of the discursive practices of different communities “within a narrative\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\nbay.\n\f"

Others have focused on close reading the text of the actual computer code gen-\nerated by Electronic Disturbance Theater or the b.a.n.g. lab, much as one might read\na poem with close attention to its rhetorical address, allusions, and tropes, while also\nacknowledging the importance of “reframing” code and thus preserving the “con-\ntext of its circulation and creation” (Marino). However, as one of the creators of\nthe code for the Transborder Immigrant Tool, Brett Stalbaum, observed at a recent\nCritical Code Studies Conference, basic code “fluency” may be more important than\nmore sophisticated forms of scholarly interpretation, particularly when university\nadministrators and investigators from law enforcement lack the basic “ability to even\nlook at source code” with comprehension and thus routinely mischaracterize the\npurpose and function of what he called a “public safety tool” (Stalbaum).\n\nAccording to a story in the Chronicle of Higher Education about a new cohort\nof “digitally incorrect” professors who seem determined. to flout their hacktivist\nprinciples, such misunderstandings may be increasingly more likely to occur now\nthat the university must grapple with assimilating “the first generation of new-\nmedia artists who migrated to academe, a group that includes not only Dominguez\nbut also “Mark Tribe, now at Brown University, and the social-activist pranksters the\nYes Men, Andy Bichlbaum (real name: Jacques Servin), at Parsons the New School\nfor Design, and Mike Bonanno (real name: Igor Vamos), at Rensselaer Polytechnic\nInstitute” (Goldstein). Many of these new-media political dissenters use the tools\nof tactical media as it is imagined most broadly by theorists like Geert Lovink to\ninclude not only computer code but also other kinds of small-scale media appro-\npriation, such as “pirated radio waves, video art, animations, hoaxes, wi-fi networks,\nmusical jam sessions, Xerox cultures, performances, grassroots robotics, cinema\nscreenings, street graffiti” (Lovink, 189). Although specific niche areas like “intellec-\ntual property hacktivism” may seem limited in effect (Irr), practitioners often earn\nconsiderable public interest and support from computer users fed up with digital-\nrights management and entertained by witty satire.\n\nBecause pursuit of the media spotlight is an essential part of hacktivism and tac-\ntical media activism, conflicts can break out among seemingly like-minded academ-\nics, particularly when authenticity might be valued over irony. For example, Kem-\nbrew McLeod irritated many colleagues when he dressed up as a robot and accosted\nformer president Bill Clinton at a televised public event about the seerningly trivial\nmatter of the former president’s criticism of hip hop artist Sista Souljah fifteen years\nearlier. McLeod, a tenured professor at the University of Iowa and creator of the\ndocumentary Copyright Criminals, had first achieved fame for trying to trademark\nthe phrase “freedom of expression” as “an ironic comment that demonstrates how\nour culture has become commodified and privately owned” and has since declared,\ndespite rising to a recognized position of tenured stability in his chosen profession,\n“T still solemnly swear to put the“ass’ back in associate professor (just as I put the‘ass’\nin assistant professor for six years)” (“My Trademark of Freedom of Expression”).\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Instead of being concerned merely with one’s\nright to speak (or sing or publish), CIS asks questions about access, costs, and chill-\ning effects on, within, and among audiences, citizens, emerging cultural creators,\nindigenous cultural groups, teachers, and students. Central to these issues is the\nidea of ‘semiotic democracy, or the ability of citizens to employ the signs and sym-\nbols ubiquitous in their environments in manners that they determine” (“After-\nword: Critical Information Studies”). Vaidhyanathan envisions a big-tent form of\ndigital humanities that “necessarily stretches to a wide array of scholarly subjects,\nemploys multiple complementary methodologies, and influences conversations far\nbeyond the gates of the university” by engaging economists, sociologists, linguists,\nanthropologists, ethnomusicologists, communication scholars, lawyers, computer\nscientists, philosophers, and librarians in a common endeavor (“Afterword: Criti-\ncal Information Studies”). For Vaidhyanathan, the digital humanities is not merely\nabout curating and managing particular digital collections; it is also about thinking\nabout systemic and structural problems and opportunities related to the political\nand legal status of digital files and data infrastructures. He is particularly enthusias-\ntic about the advocacy roles assumed by contemporary digital librarians and their\ncollaborators and points to the political work of the American Library Association\nagainst the onerous Digital Millennium Copyright Act as a model for other profes-\nsional academic associations.\n\nAlthough Vaidhyanathan and others promulgate CIS as an interdisciplinary\nfield of study that could serve as the logical successor to the areas of academic\ninquiry in cultural studies that arose from the protests of the 1960s and 1970s, which\nis now “needed to make sense of important phenomena such as copyright policy,\nelectronic voting, encryption, the state of libraries, the preservation of ancient cul-\ntural traditions, and markets for cultural production” “Afterword: Critical Infor-\nmation Studies”), advocacy for these issues in the university setting does not nec-\nessarily achieve the kind of visibility that was associated with previous movements\nthat assembled crowds of individuals for face-to-face interactions in physical pub-\nlic space to achieve an end to the Vietnam War, milestones on civil rights issues,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n(173\n\f"

Moreover, scholars\nsuch as Mimi Ito, who observe the computer practices of present-day digital youth,\nnote that online behavior oriented toward conformity, popularity, and gossip con-\ntinues to be far more common than activism and hacking, so hacktivism is likely to\ncontinue to be a minority movement within the culture at large for a very long time.\n\nNonetheless, there are calls for change in the university and for forming larger\ncoalitions between marginalized social actors and political interests; some of these\ncalls are even coming from within the ivory tower itself.

The altered roles\nof the teacher and the student substantially change teaching itself. Learning with\ndigital media isn’t about giving our well-worn teaching practices a hip appearance;\nit is, more fundamentally, about exploring radically new approaches to instruction.\nThe future of learning will not be determined by tools but by the re-organization of\npower relationships and institutional protocols” (Scholz).

But rarely\ndo we extend the issues involved into the register of society, economics, politics,\nor culture in the vintage manner, for instance, of the Computer Professionals\nfor Social Responsibility (CPSR). How the digital humanities advance, chan-\nnel, or resist the great postindustrial, neoliberal, corporatist, and globalist flows\nof information-cum-capital, for instance, is a question rarely heard in the digi-\ntai humanities associations, conferences, journals, and projects with which I am\nfamiliar. Not even the clichéd forms of such issues—e.g., “the digital divide,”\n\n“privacy, “copyright,” and so on-——get much play.\n\nLiu argues that these predictable catalogs of digital humanities products (tools, data,\nmetadata, and archives), modes of institutional membership (associations, confer-\nences, journals, and projects), and stock issues (the digital divide, privacy, and copy-\nright) add up to little critical thinking about neoliberalism at best and collaboration\nwith the enemy at worst.\n\nIn contrast, there are those who argue that the digital humanities is reaching\ntoo far and is risking the stability of academic culture itself. Ironically, this often\nhappens as a direct result of creative misreadings that take the wishful thinking of\ndigital humanities manifestos and provocations far too literally. For example, Ashley\nDawson, coauthor of Dangerous Professors: Academic Freedom and the National\nSecurity Campus, takes the recent Digital Humanities Manifesto entirely at its word\nwhen the coauthors proclaim that the digital humanities has “a utopian core shaped\nby its genealogical descent from the counterculture?cyberculture intertwinglings of\nthe 60s and. 70s” that affirms “the value of the open, the infinite, the expansive, the\nuniversity/museum/archive/library without walls” along with a radical “democrati-\nzation of culture and scholarship” (“A Digital Humanities Manifesto”)\n\nAfter reading this utopian rhetoric, Dawson worries that academic freedom\nitself might be at risk because of pressure from a well-intentioned but ultimately\nnaive digital humanities in favor of massive deinstitutionalization, deskilling, and\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n(177\n\f"

Notice, however, that the claims of Dig-\nital Humanities extend beyond simply making scholarly research more widely\navailable, as valuable as such initiates are—particularly in terms of redressing the\nwidening knowledge gap between the global North and South. In addition, the\ndigital revolution is represented in the manifesto as transforming the character\nof research itself, shaking down established disciplinary walls and promoting\n\nnovel forms of collaborative inquiry.\n\nIt is worth noting that Dawson shares with Liu an anxiety that, like transnational\ncorporations, “universities have sought to profit from the intellectual property\nproduced in research labs, libraries, and classrooms” and “to monetize knowledge”\n(Dawson) even in the formerly unprofitable humanities with new digital humani-\nties initiatives that can capitalize on the economic extraction model of contempo-\nrary global capitalism.\n\nChallenges to the Digital Humanities\n\nAlan Liu and Cathy Davidson are certainly closer to the center of the digital human-\nities as it is currently defined, and Ricardo Dominguez and Kembrew McLeod are\ndefinitely located farther away on its ideological peripheries, but they all argue for\nthe formation of new modes of institutional critique and a rethinking of the profes-\nsion, particularly—in Liu’s case—as impersonal and dehumanized distance learn-\ning becomes a very real possibility in transforming public education for the worse.\n\nHowever, the popular base of the digital humanities might still have a vested\ninterest in disciplining faculty who devote themselves not only to hacking but also to\npirating and pranking. This is particularly true for more entrenched digital human-\nists who see themselves as part of a tight-knit community devoted to a what Patrik\nSvensson has called a “tradition of humanities computing” and its associated “epis-\ntemic commitment” to understanding “information technology as a tool and writ-\nten texts as a primary object of study” in a field devoted to linguistic analysis rather\nthan social change (“Humanities Computing”). These humanities computing spe-\nclalists who represent, for Svensson, the establishment in the digital humanities tend\nto focus on the practical rather than ideological aspects of information technology\nand to seek the coherence and legibility in a given corpus, not its disruptive poten-\ntial. Furthermore, because humanities computing specialists are people who have\noften fought for computing resources for decades, frequently without the star status\nand influence that high-profile hacktivists and tactical media activists might enjoy\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Liu, we are left with an important question: is\nhacktivism relevant to the digital humanities? I suppose it depends on the form of\nthe digital humanities in question.\n\nCertainly, the history of the digital humanities, as described by Tara McPher-\nson, tells of founding fathers who turned to humanities computing not because they\nwere in love with the aquarianism of Ted Nelson but because they were in full retreat\nfrom new forms of scholarship rooted in questioning ideologies of race, gender, and\nclass as the academy underwent a fundamental transformation in the post-free-\nspeech seventies. For McPherson, this original digital humanities, defined by white\nmale conservatism, was about seeking enclaves, not networks, and deploying strat-\negies, not tactics. However, both McPherson and Patrik Svensson have argued that\nthe digital humanities has become profoundly polymorphic in the present day. As\nSvensson explains, “The territory of the digital humanities is currently under nego-\ntiation. While there is no doubt that the field is expanding, it is not entirely clear\nwhat is included and how the landscape can be understood or structured. These\nongoing negotiations occur on multiple levels, from an individual graduate student\nand local institutions to national funding agencies and international institutional\nnetworking. They are consequently situated institutionally, physically, politically\nand. epistemically” (“The Landscape”). In practice, the question might ultimately\nturn out to be, “Does hacktivism want digital humanists?” rather than, “Does the\ndigital humanities want hacktivists?” In other words, what incentives do hacktiv-\nists have to join the ranks of the digital humanities and take part in their frequently\narcane and soporific journals and conferences? Elsewhere, ] have argued that game\nstudies might turn out not to be at home in the digital humanities either (“Playing\nAgainst Type”), given the fact that research in computer games often values par-\nticipant observation rather than disinterested analysis and adopts the stance of the\nplayful life-hacker rather than the dutiful enforcer of standards. For scholars com-\ning from the world of game studies, digital life and real life intermingle, the exploit\nfunctions as a site of intervention, and breaking systems is just part of the fun. If the\ndigital humanities foregrounds neutral disembodied approaches and taxonomies of\nabstracted data, the most interesting work in game studies often takes the opposite\napproach by embracing either feminist perspectives that emphasize embodied inter-\nactions or methods derived from object-oriented ontology that foreground material\nassemblages and constraints. Recently Douglas Eyman and others associated with\nthe techrhet listserv have also announced that they would rather be affiliated with\ndigital rhetoric than with the digital humanities and have cast aspersions on the\npursuit of funding by recent digital humanities converts, when a large community\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\nL179\n\f"

Ontology, not ethics, must offer us first prin-\nciples ...“The public” is a big place. It’s not just a place for states and voters and\nballot propositions. It’s also a place for legwarmers and silicone breast implants\n\nand hot vinegar pickled green beans. (Bogost, “We Think in Public”)\n\nFor Bogost, the stakes of being a public intellectual are less about being identified\nas a prominent liberal or conservative professor of record in the media and more\nabout engaging with issues of everyday concern in material culture. He argues that\npublic intellectuals should be interested in interpreting the concrete details of daily\nlife in meaningful ways rather than merely spouting abstractions.\n\nIn answering Bogost’s objection that public intellectuals tend to stay inside the\nivory tower, it’s worth noting that many hacktivists not only address the issues of a\ndeliberative public culture defined by the two-party system and English common\nlaw but also create works about the quotidian materiality of technology and human\nculture and the contingent character of consumer comforts in the developed world.\nFor example, hacktivists affiliated with CAE and EDT have created art projects\ndesigned to draw attention to the chemical composition and physical properties of\ngenetically modified food and of nanotechnology that creates “beer bottles that are\nless likely to break, coating in glass that makes it easier to clean, improved water fil-\ntration systems, pants that liquid rolls right off of and stronger tennis rackets” (Ben-\nnett). Moreover, issues of interest to hacktivists rarely fall neatly along the party lines\nof the supposed. political correctness that Bogost describes. For example, laws for\nnetwork neutrality, liberalization of copyright laws, and increased passenger privacy\nhave all been thwarted by prominent liberal legislators as well as conservative ones.\n\nDuring the recent Day of Digital Humanities, Bogost contended that the digital\nhumanities needed to make a similar commitment to “getting real” and to overcom-\ning the legacy of idealism that it inherited (“Getting Real”). To support his argu-\nment, he cited the response of fellow academic blogger Alex Reid to evangelize for\na fundamentally different kind of digital humanities that could engage with matters\nrelevant to the specific and the everyday:\n\nFor centuries (if not always), the humanities have dealt with objects: books,\nhistorical artifacts, works of art, performances, films, etc. ... We have largely\n\ndealt with these objects in two ways. 1) We have addressed our human response,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:44 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

As such, when we speak of\nthe digital we have focused on the digital as a mode of representation and we\nave consider[{ed] “digital culture” in broad and abstract terms. A realist ontol-\nogy allows us to investigate objects in new ways. It makes the laptop, the mobile\nphone, the AR network, the procedurality of the video game all sites for human-\n\nistic investigation in new ways. (Reid)\n\nBogost remarks that only “age, ignorance, truculence, or idiocy” can explain why\n“the humanities have tried desperately to pretend that the material world is the same\nas ever” (“Getting Real”).\n\nerhaps it is not heretical to say that the digital humanities is actually more\nabout bit rot and obsolete file formats than it is about spreadsheets with clean data\nand. perfect, high-definition information visualizations that capture every detail\nwith total fidelity. Because being responsible for digital humanities projects forces\nscholars to care about mundane matters like maintaining servers and replacing\nrouters and even getting the right kind of heating and cooling systems, this peculiar\n\n \n\nbreed of academic must also come to understand the instability and materiality of\nthe archive rather than its permanence and abstraction. Even the digital files that are\nmigrated into the cloud exist somewhere in time and space. Adopting basic princi-\nples of redundancy and distribution in contemporary archival practices should not\nbe mistaken for delivering on a promise of immortality and omnipresence. Futuris-\ntic technologies like satellites and data barges still involve all the legal complexities\nof property and territory in specific geopolitical domains. As more digital humani-\nties projects, such as the recent Digging into Data challenge from the NEH, require\ninternational collaboration, the geopolitical, logistical, and material complications\nof the digital humanities are likely to become of even greater concern. Of course,\nnarratives of progress are much more likely to attract funding than narratives of fail-\nure, but the digital humanities has important failure stories to tell that are instruc-\ntive for the academy as a whole, because universities are increasingly dependent on\nglobal networks and computer technologies.\n\nTn the end, both the hacktivist and the more mainstream digital humanist must\nbe sensitive to the vulnerability and imperfection of digital knowledge systems to\npursue their avocations on a day-to-day basis. In considering the need for support-\ning a truly hacktivist digital humanities, perhaps we can imagine the forms of activ-\nism that they both could undertake and the publics who might respond to their col-\nlaborations. As Bruno Latour has argued, the mundane and the institutional can be\npart of the same assemblage, and everyday politics with a small “p” frequently inter-\nsects with epic politics with a capital “P” In thinking about the relationship between\nforms of symbolic representation that humanists care about and forms of political\nrepresentation that activists care about, perhaps we need to break some systems to\nunderstand how they are made.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 01 N on Thu, 61 Jan 1976 12:34:56 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\n[181\n\f"

For instance, in June 2008, Wired maga-\n\nMa\n\nzine opened its special section on “The Petabyte Age” by stating, “Our ability\nto capture, warehouse, and understand massive amounts of data is changing science,\nmedicine, business, and technology. As our collection of facts and figures grows, so\nwill the opportunity to find answers to fundamental questions.” In February 2010,\nThe Economist started its special report “Data, Data Everywhere” with the phrase\n“the industrial revolution of data” (coined by computer scientist Joe Hellerstein)\nand then went to note that “the effect is being felt everywhere, from business to sci-\nence, from government to the arts.”\n\nDiscussions in popular media usually do not define big data in qualitative\nterms. However, in the computer industry, the term has a more precise meaning:\n“Big Data is a term applied to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly\nused software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable\nelapsed time. Big data sizes are a constantly moving target currently ranging from\na few dozen terabytes to many petabytes of data in a single data set” (“Big Data”).\n\nSince its formation in 2008, the Office of Digital Humanities at the National\nEndowment for Humanities (NEH) has been systematically creating grant oppor-\ntunities to help humanists work with large data sets. The following statement from\na 2011 grant competition organized by the NEH together with a number of other\nresearch agencies in the United States, Canada, the UK, and the Netherlands pro-\nvides an excellent description of what is at stake: “The idea behind the Digging\ninto Data Challenge is to address how ‘big data’ changes the research landscape for\nthe humanities and social sciences. Now that we have massive databases of materi-\nals used by scholars in the humanities and social sciences—ranging from digitized\nbooks, newspapers, and music to transactional data like web searches, sensor data\nor cell phone records—what new, computationally-based research methods might\nwe apply? As the world becomes increasingly digital, new techniques will be needed\nto search, analyze, and understand these everyday materials” (“Digging into Data\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:59 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

The projects funded by the 2009 Digging into Data Challenge and the\nearlier NEH 2008 Humanities High Performance Computing Grant Program have\nbegun to map the landscape of data-intensive humanities. They include analysis of\nthe correspondence of European thinkers between 1500 and 1800; maps, texts, and\nimages associated with nineteenth-century railroads in the United States; crimi-\nnal trial accounts (data size: 127 million words); ancient texts; detailed 3-D maps\nof ancient Rome; and the research by my lab to develop tools for the analysis and\nvisualization of large image and video data sets.\n\nAt the moment of this writing, the largest data sets being used in digital human-\nities projects are much smaller than big data used by scientists; in fact, if we use\nindustry's definition, almost none of them qualify as big data (Le., the work can\nbe done on desktop computers using standard software, as opposed to supercom-\nputers). But this gap will eventually disappear when humanists start working with\nborn-digital user-generated content (such as billions of photos on Flickr), online\nuser communication (comments about photos), user created metadata (tags), and\ntransaction data (when and from where the photos were uploaded). This web con-\ntent and data is infinitely larger than all already digitized cultural heritage; and, in\ncontrast to the fixed number of historical artifacts, it grows constantly. (L expect that\nthe number of photos uploaded to Facebook daily is larger than all artifacts stored\nin all the world’s museums.)\n\nIn this chapter, I want to address some of the theoretical and practical issues\nraised by the possibility of using massive amounts of such social and cultural data\nin the humanities and social sciences. My observations are based on my own experi-\nence working since 2007 with large cultural data sets at the Software Studies Initia-\ntive (softwarestudies.com) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). The\nissues that I will discuss include the differences between “deep data” about a few\npeople and “surface data” about many people, getting access to transactional data,\nand. the new “data analysis divide” between data experts and researchers without\ntraining in computer science.\n\nThe emergence of social media in the middle of the 2000s created opportunities\nto study social and cultural processes and dynamics in new ways. For the first time,\nwe can follow imaginations, opinions, ideas, and feelings of hundreds of millions of\npeople. We can see the images and the videos they create and comment on, moni-\ntor the conversations they are engaged in, read their blog posts and tweets, navigate\ntheir maps, listen to their track lists, and follow their trajectories in physical space.\nAnd we don’t need to ask their permission to do this, since they themselves encour-\n\n \n\nage us to do so by making all of this data public.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the study of the social and the cultural relied on two\ntypes of data: “surface data” about lots of people and “deep data” about the few indi-\nviduals or small groups.’ The first approach was used in all disciplines that adapted\nquantitative methods (ic., statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:59 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\n{ 461\n\f"

The relevant fields include quantitative schools of sociology,\neconomics, political science, communication studies, and marketing research.\n\nThe second approach was used in humanities fields such as literary studies, art\nhistory, film studies, and history. It was also used in qualitative schools in psychol-\nogy (for instance, psychoanalysis and Gestalt psychology), sociology (Wilhelm Dil-\nthey, Max Weber, Georg Simmel), anthropology, and ethnography. The examples\nof relevant methods are hermeneutics, participant observation, thick description,\nsemiotics, and close reading.\n\nFor example, a quantitative sociologist worked with census data that covered\nmost of the country’s citizens. However, this data was collected only every ten years,\nand it represented each individual only on a macro level, living out her or his opin-\nions, feelings, tastes, moods, and motivations (“U.S. Census Bureau”). In contrast,\na psychologist would be engaged with a single patient for years, tracking and inter-\npreting exactly the kind of data that the census did not capture.\n\nIn between these two methodologies of surface data and deep data were sta-\ntistics and the concept of sampling. By carefully choosing her sample, a researcher\ncould expand certain types of data about the few into the knowledge about the\nmany. For example, starting in the 1950s, the Nielsen Company collected television\nviewing data in a sample of American homes (via diaries and special devices con-\nnected to television sets in twenty-five thousand homes) and then used this sam-\nple data to predict television ratings for the whole country (Le., percentages of the\npopulation which watched particular shows). But the use of samples to learn about\nlarger populations had many limitations.\n\nFor instance, in the example of Nielson’s television ratings, the small sample did\nnot tell us anything about the actual hour-by-hour, day-to-day patterns of television\nviewing of every individual or every family outside of this sample. Maybe certain\npeople watched only news the whole day; others only tuned in to concerts; others\nhad the television on but never paid attention to it; still others happened to prefer\nthe shows that got very low ratings by the sample group, and so on. The sample\nstats could not tell us anything about this. It was also possible that a particular tele-\nvision program would get zero shares because nobody in the sample audience hap-\npened to watch it—and in fact, this occurred more than once (“Nielsen Ratings”).\n\nImagine that we want to scale up a low-resolution image using a digital image\neditor like Photoshop. For example, we start with a ten-by-ten pixel image (one\nhundred pixels in total) and resize it to one thousand by one thousand (one million\npixels in total). We do not get any new details—only larger pixels. This is exactly\nwhat happens when you use a small sample to predict the behavior of a much larger\npopulation. A “pixel” that originally represented one person comes to represent one\nthousand people who are all assumed to behave in exactly the same way.\n\nThe rise of social media, along with new computational tools that can process\n\n \n\nmassive amounts of data, makes possible a fundamentally new approach to the\n\n \n\nstudy of human beings and society. We no longer have to choose between data size\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:59 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

We also need to be clear about\nwhat skills digital humanists need to take advantage of the new scale of human data.\n\n1. Only social media companies have access to really large social data sets, espe-\ncially transactional data. An anthropologist working for Facebook or a sociologist\nworking for Google will have access to data that the rest of the scholarly commu-\nnity will not.\n\nA researcher can obtain some of this data through APIs provided by most social\nmedia services and the largest media online retailers (YouTube, Flickr, Amazon,\netc.). An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of commands that can\nbe used by a user program to retrieve the data stored in a company’s databases. For\nexample, the Flickr API can be used to download all photos ina particular group and\nalso to retrieve information about the size of each photo, available comments, geolo-\ncation, the list of people who favored this photo, and so on (“Flickr API Methods”).\n\nThe public APIs provided by social media and social network companies do\nnot give all data that these companies themselves are capturing about the users. Still,\nyou can certainly do very interesting new cultural and social research by collecting\ndata via APIs and then analyzing it—if you are good at programming, statistics,\nand other data analysis methods. (In my lab, we have recently used Flickr API to\ndownload one hundred and sixty-seven thousand images from the “Art Now” Flickr\ngroup, and we are currently working to analyze these images to create a “map” of\n“user-generated art.”)\n\nAlthough APIs themselves are not complicated, all truly large-scale research\nprojects that use the data with these APIs so far have been undertaken by researchers\nin computer science. A good way to follow the work in this area is to look at papers\npresented at yearly World Wide Web conferences (WWW2009 and WWW2010).\nRecent papers have investigated how information spreads on Twitter (data: 100\nmillion tweets, Kwak, Lee, Park, and Moon), what qualities are shared by the most\nfavored photos on Flickr (data: 2.2 million photos), how geotagged Flickr photos are\ndistributed spatially (data: 35 million photos, Crandall, Backstrom, Huttenlocher,\nand Kleinberg), and how user-generated videos on YouTube compare with similar\nvideos on Daum, the most popular UGC (user-generated content) service in Korea\n(data: 2.1 million videos, Cha, Kwak, Rodriguez, Ahn, and Moon).\n\nIt is worth pointing out that even researchers working inside the largest social\nmedia companies can’t simply access all the data collected by different services in\na company. Some time ago, I went to a talk by a researcher from Sprint, one of the\nlargest U.S. phone companies, who was analyzing the relations between geographic\naddresses of phone users and how frequently they called other people. He did have\n\n \n\naccess to this data for all Sprint customers (around fifty million). However, when he\nwas asked why he did not use other data collected by Sprint, such as instant messages\nand apps usage, he explained that these services are operated by a different part of\nthe company and that the laws prohibit employees to have access to all of this data\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:59 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

He pointed out that like any other company, Sprint does not want to get\ninto lawsuits for breach of privacy and pay huge fines and damage their brand image;\ntherefore they are being very careful in terms of who gets to look at what data. You\ndon’t have to believe this, but I do. For example, do you think Google enjoys all the\nlawsuits about Street View? If you were running a business, would you risk losing\nhundreds of millions of dollars and badly damaging your company image?\n\n2, We need to be careful of reading communications over social networks and\ndigital footprints as “authentic.” Peoples’ posts, tweets, uploaded photographs, com-\nments, and other types of online participation are not transparent windows into\ntheir selves; instead, they are usually carefully curated and systematically managed\n(Ellison, Heino, and Gibbs).\n\nImagine that you wanted to study the cultural imagination of people in Russia\nin the second part of 1930s and you only looked at newspapers, books, films, and\nother cultural texts, which of course all went through government censors before\nbeing approved for publication. You would conclude that indeed everybody in Rus-\n\n \n\nsia loved Lenin and Stalin, was very happy, and was ready to sacrifice his or her life\nto build communism. You may say that this is an unfair comparison and that it\nwould be more appropriate to look instead at people’s diaries. Yes, indeed it would\nbe better; however, if you were living in Russia in that period and you knew that any\n\n \n\nnight a black car might stop in front of your house and you would be taken away\nand probably shot soon thereafter, would you really commit all your true thoughts\nabout Stalin and government to paper? In 1993, the famous Russian poet Osip Man-\ndelstam wrote a short poem that criticized Stalin only indirectly without even nam-\ning him, and he paid for this with his life (“Stalin Epigram”).\n\nToday, if you live in a pretty large part of the world, you know that the gov-\nernment is likely to scan your electronic communications systematically (“Internet\nCensorship by country”). In some countries, citizens may be arrested simply for\nvisiting a wrong website. In these countries, you will be careful about what you are\nsaying online. Some of us live in other countries where a statement against the gov-\nernment does not automatically put you in prison, and therefore people feel they\ncan be more open. In other words, it does not matter if the government is track-\ning us or not; what is important is what it can do with this information. (1 grew up\nin the Soviet Union in the 1970s and then moved to the United States; based on\nmy experience living in both societies, in this respect the difference between them\nis very big. In the USSR, we never made any political jokes on the phone and only\ndiscussed politics with close friends at home.)\n\nNow let us assume that we are living in a country where we are highly unlikely\nto be prosecuted for occasional antigovernment remarks. But still, how authen-\ntic are all the rest of our online expressions? As Ervin Goffman and other sociolo-\ngists pointed. out a long time ago, people always construct their public presence,\ncarefully shaping how they present themselves to others, and social media is cer-\ntainly not an exception to this (“Ervin Goffman”), though the degree of this public\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:59 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\n| 465\n\f"

For instance, most of us tend to do less self-censorship and\nediting on Facebook than in the profiles on dating sites or in a job interview. Others\ncarefully curate their profile pictures to construct an image they want to project. (If\nyou scan your friends’ Facebook profile pictures, you are likely to find a big range).\nBut just as we do in all other areas of our everyday lives, we exercise some control\nall the time when we are online—what we say, what we upload, what we show as\nour interests, and so on.\n\nAgain, this does not mean that we can’t do interesting research by analyzing\nlarger numbers of tweets, Facebook photos, YouTube videos, or any other social\nmedia site—we just have to keep in mind that all these data are not a transparent\nwindow into peoples’ imaginations, intentions, motifs, opinions, and ideas. It’s more\nappropriate to think of it as an interface people present to the world—that is, a par-\nticular view that shows only some parts of their actual lives and imaginations and\nmay also include other fictional data designed to project a particular image (Elli-\nson, Heino, and Gibbs).\n\n3. Is it really true that “we no longer have to choose between data size and data\ndepth,” as I stated? Yes and no. Imagine this hypothetical scenario. On the one side,\nwe have ethnographers who are spending years inside a particular community. On\nanother side, we have computer scientists who never meet people in this commu-\nnity but have access to their social media and digital footprints—daily spatial tra-\njectories captured with GPS and all video recorded by surveillance cameras, online\nand offline conversations, uploaded media, comments, likes, and so on. According\nto my earlier argument, both parties have “deep data,” but the advantage of a com-\nputer science team is that they can capture this data about hundreds of millions of\npeople as opposed to only small community.\n\nHow plausible is this argument? For thousands of years, we would learn about\nother people exclusively through personal interactions. Later, letter writing became\nan important new mechanism for building personal (especially romantic) relation-\nships. In the twenty-first century, we can have access to a whole new set of machine-\ncaptured traces and records of individuals’ activities. Given that this situation is very\nnew, it is to be expected that some people will find it hard to accept the concept that\nsuch machine records can be as meaningful in helping us to understand commu-\nnities and individuals as face-to-face interaction. They will argue that whatever the\nquality of the data sources, data analysis ideas, and algorithms used. by computer\nscientists, they will never arrive at the same insights and understanding of people\nand. dynamics in the community as ethnographers. They will say that even the most\ncomprehensive social data about people which can be automatically captured via\ncameras, sensors, computer devices (phones, game consoles), and web servers can’t\nbe used to arrive at the same “deep” knowledge.\n\nIt is possible to defend both positions, but what if both are incorrect?

Therefore they are likely to ask different questions,\nnotice different patterns, and arrive at different insights.\n\nThis does not mean that the new computer-captured “deep surface” of data is\nless “deep” than the data obtained through long-term personal contact. In terms of\nthe sheer number of “data points,” it is likely to be much deeper. However, many of\nthese data points are quite different than the data points available to ethnographers.\n\nFor instance, if you are physically present in some situation, you may notice\nsome things that you would not notice if you were watching a high-res video of the\nsame situation. But at the same time, if you do computer analysis of this video you\nmay find patterns you would not notice if you were on the scene only physically.\nOf course, people keep coming up with new techniques that combine on-the-scene\nphysical presence and computer and network-assisted techniques. For a good exam-\nple of such innovation, see the Valley of the Khans project at UCSD. In this proj-\nect, photos captured by small unmanned aerial vehicles sent out by an archeologi-\ncal team moving around a large area in Mongolia are immediately uploaded to a\nspecial National Geographic site, exploration.nationalgeographic.com. Thousands\nof people immediately start tagging these photos for interesting details, which tells\narcheologists what to look for on the ground (“Help Find Genghis Khan’s Tomb”).\n\nThe questions of what can be discovered and understood with computer anal-\nysis of social and cultural data versus traditional qualitative methods are particu-\nlarly important for the digital humanities. My hypothetical example used data about\nsocial behavior, but the “data” can also be eighteenth-century letters of European\nthinkers, nineteenth-century maps and texts about railroads, hundreds of thou-\nsands of images uploaded by users to a Flickr group, or any other set of cultural\nartifacts. When we start reading these artifacts with computers, humanists become\nvery nervous.\n\nToften experience this reaction when I lecture about digital humanities research\ndone in my lab Software Studies Initiative at UCSD (softwarestudies.com). The lab\nfocuses on the development of methods and tools for exploration and the research\nof massive cultural visual data, both digitized visual artifacts and contemporary\nvisual and interactive media (“Software Studies: Cultural Analytics”). We use digi-\ntal image analysis and new visualization techniques to explore cultural patterns in\nlarge sets of images and video: user-generated video, visual art, magazine covers and\npages, graphic design, photographs, feature films, cartoons, and motion graphics.\nExamples of the visual data sets we have analyzed include 20,000 pages of Science\nand Popular Science magazines issues published between 1872 and 1922, 780 paint-\nings by Van Gogh, 4,535 covers of Time magazine (1923-2009), and 1,074,790 pages\n(“One Million Manga Pages”).\n\nIn our experience, almost every time we analyze and then visualize a new image\nor video collection, or even a single time-based media artifact (a music video, a\nfeature film, a video recording of a game play), we find some surprising new pat-\nterns.

However, there are also many kinds of\ninteresting questions that require expertise in computer science, statistics, and data\nmining—something that social and humanities researchers typically don’t have.\nThis is another serious objection to the optimistic view of big data-driven humani-\nties and social research I presented earlier.\n\nThe explosion of data and the emergence of computational data analysis as the\nkey scientific and economic approach in contemporary societies create new kinds\nof divisions. Specifically, people and organizations are divided into three categories:\nthose who create data (both consciously and by leaving digital footprints), those\nwho have the means to collect it, and those who have the expertise to analyze it.\nThe first group includes pretty much everybody in the world who is using the web\nor mobile phones; the second group is smaller; and the third group is much smaller\nstill. We can refer to these three groups as the new “data classes” of our “big-data\nsociety” (my neologisms).\n\nAt Google, computer scientists are working on the algorithms that scan a web\npage a user is on currently and select which ads to display. At YouTube, computer\nscientists work on algorithms that automatically show a list of other videos deemed\nto be relevant to one you are currently watching. At BlogPulse, computer scientists\nwork on algorithms that allow companies to use sentiment analysis to study the\nfeelings that millions of people express about their products in blog posts. At cer-\ntain Hollywood movie studios, computer scientists work on algorithms that predict\nthe popularity of forthcoming movies by analyzing tweets about them (it works).\nIn each case, the data and the algorithms can also reveal really interesting things\nabout human cultural behavior in general, but this is not what the companies who\nare employing these computer scientists are interested in. Instead, the analytics are\nused for specific business ends. For more examples, see “What People Want (and\nHow to Predict it).”\n\nSo what about the rest of us? Today we are given a variety of sophisticated\nand free software tools to select the content of interest to us from this massive and\nconstantly expanding universe of professional media offerings and user-generated\nmedia. These tools include search engines, RSS feeds, and recommendation sys-\ntems. But while they can help you find what to read, view, listen to, play, remix,\nshare, comment on, and contribute to, in general they are not designed for carry-\ning systematic social and cultural research along the lines of the “cultural analytics”\nscenario I described earlier.\n\nWhile a number of free data analysis and visualization tools have become avail-\nable on the web during last few years (Many Eyes, Tableau, Google docs, etc.), they\nare not useful unless you have access to large social data sets. Some commercial web\ntools allow anybody to analyze certain kinds of trends in certain data sets they are\ncoupled with in some limited ways (or, at least, they whet our appetites by show-\ning what is possible). 1 am thinking of already mentioned Google Books Ngram\nViewer, Trends, Insights for Search, Blogpulse, and also YouTube Trends Dashboard,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:59 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

(I will return to this crisis later.) She was not\nalone in thinking that the computer would make a great difference to all fields of\nstudy, but she seems to have been one of the very few who argued for qualitative\nrather than quantitative change—different ideas rather than simply more evidence,\nobtained faster and more easily in greater abundance, to support ideas we already\nhave in ways we already understand. Masterman was a linguist and philosopher;\npioneer in computational linguistics; one-time student of Ludwig Wittgenstein;\nplaywright and novelist; founder and director of the Cambridge Language Research\nUnit; adventurous and imaginative experimenter with computing, for example in\ncomposing haikus and arguing for the significance of such work against sometimes\nferocious opposition; and part of a community of people genuinely, intelligently\nexcited about the possibilities, however implausible, that the computer was then\nopening up before hype muddied the waters.\n\nMasterman begins her contribution to Freeing the Mind by distancing herself\nfrom her predecessors’ evident notion that the digital computer is “a purely menial\ntool”: “in fact ...a kind of intellectual spade. This, it has been shown, can indeed\nassist a human scholar ... by performing for him a series of irksome repetitive\ntasks ... that the scholar, unaided, just cannot get through. ... They take too long,\nthey are backbreaking, they are eye-wearing, they strain too far human capacity\nfor maintaining accuracy: in fact, they are both physically and intellectually crush-\ning” (38). She had (can we have?) quite other ideas. Nevertheless the complaint\npointed to a very real problem—that is, very real drudgery that at various times\nthe demands of maritime navigation, the bureaucratic state, warfare, and scientific\nresearch inflicted on those who were professionally adept at calculation. Thus Gott-\nfried Wilhelm Leibniz complained about enslavement to “dull but simple tasks” in\nthe seventeenth century, Charles Babbage in the nineteenth, and Herman Golds-\ntine in the twentieth (Goldstine, 8~12; Pratt, 20-44). All three responded by devis-\ning computational machinery. We certainly cannot and should not deny the crip-\npling effects of the mathematical drudgery about which they all complained. But,\nMasterman insisted, these spadework uses, however welcome the time and effort\nthey liberate, “provoke no new theoretic vision” (“The Intellect’s New Eye’, 38).\nRelief of others’ drudgery is a noble undertaking, but to slip from laudable service\nof that practical need to the notion that the computer is for drudgery is a profound\nerror. It is an error that became an occupational hazard among early practitioners\nof humanities computing.\n\nIn 1978, literary scholar Susan Wittig paused to take stock of accomplishments\nin computing for her field. Quoting Masterman via an article promoting content\nanalysis for literary study (Ellis and Favat), Wittig argued that Masterman’s call for\nmore than spadework had come to naught.

Also that year, Mark Olsen, presiding over the development of tools\nfor one of the early large corpora, the Trésor de la Langue Francaise, at the Ameri-\ncan and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language project (ARTFL),\nshocked and even outraged many of those most closely involved with the field by\narguing in an Modern Language Association (MLA) paper for what Franco Moretti\nhas more recently called “distant reading.” A special issue of Computers and the\nHumanities, centered on a revised version of that paper, was published two years\nlater (Computers and the Humanities 27.5~6). In it, Olsen sounded the familiar sen-\ntence: “Computer-aided literature studies have failed to have a significant impact\non the field as a whole” (“Signs, Symbols and Discourses: A New Direction for\nComputer-Aided Literature Studies,” 309). Again, but as Yaacov Choueka said in\nsomewhat different terms in 1988, “The tools are here, what about results?”*\n\nSo given the catalog of failings and disappointments that emerges from the\ncomplaints of practitioners, I ask the same question that architectural designer John\nHamilton Frazer recently asked of once adventurous British computer art: “What\nwent wrong?” (Brown et al., 50). This is not an idle question, for the digital humani-\nties especially in regard of its strong tendency to define itself as serving client disci-\nplines, which tend to initiate collaborations, set the agenda for the research and take\nacademic credit for the result. As the popular metaphor of “text-mining,” the focus\non large infrastructural projects, and the preoccupation with standards suggest,\nanticipation of service to be rendered moves the field toward an industrial model,\nin which curiosity-motivated research is subordinated to large-scale production,\nbetter to facilitate research that happens elsewhere by other means. Big Science is\ncited as a precedent without anyone asking about the historically documented and\nprominently attested consequences for the affected sciences. But to answer this his-\ntorical question properly for the disciplines most affected—those for which inter-\npretation of cultural artefacts is the central activity—-would require more than any\nof the surveys of the last three or more decades. I am convinced, but cannot yet\ndemonstrate, that an adequate historical account could be written and that a gen-\nuine history of the digital humanities in its first half century would greatly help\nus turn pitiful laments and dull facts into the stimulating questions we should be\nasking now. To write such an account, however, an historian would have to locate\npractitioners’ minority concerns within the broad cultural landscape of the time\nand then describe the complex pattern of confluence and divergence of numerous\ninterrelated developments.* These practitioners were not working in a vacuums it\nis trivial to demonstrate that they were well aware of what was going on elsewhere.\nWhy did they react (or not) as they did?\n\nMy intention here is much more modest. I want to talk about what we can do\nmeanwhile, reflectively, to address our own predicaments beyond simply recogniz-\ning them.\n\nA start may be made with the manner in which we now express our worries.\nNo doubt in response to the demands for accountability from funding agencies, we\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:31 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[17\n\f"

What kinds of work can be done under the\ncircumstances in which we find ourselves?

The question was debated briefly on the Humanist listserv from late\nOctober to early December 2010.5 Here [return to a remark I reported there from\nthe current UK science minister, David Willetts. Justifying the protected funding\nfor the sciences, he noted that “the scientific community has assembled. very pow-\n\n \n\nerful evidence such as in that Royal Society report, The Scientific Century, about\nwhat the benefits are for scientific research. Now you can argue that it’s all worth-\nwhile in its own rights, but the fact that it clearly contributes to the performance\nof the economy and the well-being of citizens—that’s really strong evidence, and\nwe deployed it?’ Arguing for economic benefits is a long reach for the humanities,\nbut “the well-being of citizens” is not. What can the digital humanities do for the\nhumanities as a whole that helps these disciplines improve the well-being of us all?\n\nAnd so I come to the debate I think we should be having.\n\nWe who have been working in the field know that the digital humanities can\nprovide better resources for scholarship and better access to them. We know that in\nthe process of designing and constructing these resources our collaborators often\nundergo significant growth in their understanding of digital tools and methods and\nthat this sometimes, perhaps even in a significant majority of cases, fosters insight\ninto the originating scholarly questions. Sometimes secular metanoia is not too\nstrong a term to describe the experience. All this has for decades been the experi-\nence of those who guided collaborating scholars or were guided as scholars them-\nselves through a gradual questioning of the original provocation to research, seeing\nit change as the struggle to render it computationally tractable progressed. In a sense,\nthere is nothing new here to anyone who has ever attempted to get to the bottom\nof anything complex and ended up with, as Busa said, a mystery, something tacit,\nsomething that escapes the net. So not only is evidence of value to our collaborat-\ning colleagues thick on the ground, but it is also to be expected as a normal part of\nscholarship. But what about the argument? By definition evidence is information\nthat backs up an argument. In other words, no argument, no evidence, only raw,\nuncommitted information.\n\nThe problem we have and must debate, then, is the argument or set of argu-\nments that will convert decades of experience into (I believe, from a quarter century\nof it) incontrovertible evidence of intellectual value.

Merton, was an idea: the\n\n~«\n\nyounger Merton’s “Science, Technology and Society in Seventeenth Century En-\ngland” defined history of technology as social history for a generation’ By the time\nMerton was writing in the 1930s, the cultural climate had changed and the consoli-\ndating and methodological activities of the teacher were giving way to the theoreti-\ncal activities of the student.\n\nI believe we are at a similar moment of change right now that we are entering\na new phase of scholarship that will be dominated not by ideas but once again by\norganizing activities, in terms of both organizing knowledge and organizing our-\nselves and our work. My difficulty in answering the question, “What's the big idea\nin history right now?” stems from the fact that, as a digital historian, I traffic much\nless in new theories than in new methods. The new technology of the Internet has\nshifted the work of a rapidly growing number of scholars away from thinking big\nthoughts to forging new tools, methods, materials, techniques, and modes or work\nthat will enable us to harness the still unwieldy, but obviously game-changing, infor-\nmation technologies now sitting on our desktops and in our pockets. These con-\ncerns touch all scholars. The Center for History and New Media’s Zotero research\nmanagement tool is used by more than a million people, all of them grappling\nwith the problem of information overload. And although much of the discussion\nremains informal, it's no accident that Wikipedia is right now one of the hottest\ntopics for debate among scholars.\n\nPerhaps most telling is the excitement that now (or, really, once again) sur-\nrounds the library. The buzz among librarians these days dwarfs anything I have seen\nin my entire career among historians. The terms “library geek” and “sexy librarian”\nhave gained new currency as everyone begins to recognize the potential of exciting\nlibrary-centered projects like Google Books.\n\nAll these things—collaborative encyclopedism, tool building, librarianship—\nfit uneasily into the standards of scholarship forged in the second half of the twen-\ntieth century. Most committees for promotion and tenure, for example, must\nvalue single authorship and the big idea more highly than collaborative work and\nmethodological or disciplinary contribution. Even historians find it hard to inter-\nnalize the fact that their own norms and values have and will again change over\ntime. But change they must. In the days of George Sarton, a thorough bibliogra-\nphy was an achievement worthy of great respect and an office closer to the refer-\nence desk in the library an occasion for great celebration. (Sarton’s small suite in\nstudy 189 of Harvard’s Widener Library was the epicenter of history of science in\nAmerica for more than a quarter century.)

Of course, this\n(at times explicit) repudiation of criticality could be viewed as part of what makes\ncertain aspects of the digital humanities so intriguing at the moment. From this per-\nspective, exponents of the computational turn are precisely net making what I have\nelsewhere characterized as the antipolitical gesture of conforming to accepted (and\noften moralistic) conceptions of politics that have been decided in advance, includ-\ning those that see it only in terms of power, ideology, race, gender, class, sexuality,\necology, affect, and so forth (Hall, Digitize). Refusing to “go through the motions\nof a critical avant-garde,” to borrow the words of Bruno Latour, they are respond-\ning to what is perceived as a fundamentally new cultural situation and the challenge\nit represents to our traditional methods of studying culture by avoiding such con-\nventional gestures and experimenting with the development of fresh methods and\napproaches for the humanities instead.’\n\nIna series of posts on his Found History blog, Tom Scheinfeldt, managing direc-\ntor at the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, positions\nsuch scholarship very much in terms of a shift from a concern with theory and ide-\nology to a concern with methodology:\n\nI believe ... we are entering a new phase of scholarship that will be dominated\nnot by ideas, but once again by organizing activities, both in terms of organiz-\ning knowledge and organizing ourselves and our work ... as a digital historian,\n\nI traffic much less in new theories than in new methods.

And I would potentially include in this process of experimentation\ntechniques and methodologies drawn from computer science and other related\nfields such as information visualization, data mining, and so forth. Yes, of course, it\nis quite possible that as Daniel W. Stowell, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln\nproject at the Illinois Historic Preservation Society puts it, in the future “people will\nuse this data in ways we can’t even imagine yet,” both singularly and collaboratively\n(cited in Cohen, “Digital Keys”). Still, there is something intriguing about the way\nin which many defenders of the turn toward computational tools and methods in\nthe humanities evoke a sense of time in relation to theory.\n\nTake the argument—one I have heard put forward at a number of different\nevents now-—that critical and self-reflexive theoretical questions about the use of\ndigital tools and data-led methodologies should be deferred. for the time being,\nlest they have the effect of strangling at birth what could turn out to be a very dif-\nferent form of humanities research before it has had a chance to properly develop\nand take shape. Viewed in isolation, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to decide\nwhether this particular form of “limitless” postponement (Deleuze, 5) is serving as\nan alibi for a naive and rather superficial form of scholarship (Meeks) or whether\nit is indeed acting as a responsible, political or ethical opening to the (heterogene-\nity and incalculability of the) future, including the future of the humanities. After\nall, the suggestion is that now is not the right time to be making any such decision\nor judgment, since we cannot yet know how humanists will eventually come to use\nthese tools and data and thus what data-driven scholarship may or may not turn\nout to be capable of critically, politically, theoretically.\n\nThis argument would be more convincing as a responsible political or ethical\ncall to leave the question of the use of digital tools and data-led methodologies in\nthe humanities open if it were the only sense in which time was evoked in relation\nto theory in this context. Significantly, it is not. As we have seen, advocates for the\ncomputational turn do so in a number of other and often competing senses, too.\nThese include the following:\n\n1.

That the time to return to theory, or for theory to (re-)emerge in some new,\nunpredictable form that represents a fundamental breakthrough or advance,\nalthough possibly on its way, has not arrived yet and cannot necessarily be\nexpected to do so for some time given that “most theoretical advances play\n\nout over generations” (Scheinfeldt, “Response”)\n\nAll of this gives a very different inflection to the view of theoretical critique as\nbeing at best inappropriate and at worst harmful to data-driven scholarship. Even\na brief glance at the history of theory’s reception in the English-speaking world is\nsometimes enough to reveal that those who announce its time has not yet come,\nor is already over, that theory is in decline or even dead and that we now live in a\nposttheoretical world, are more often than not endeavoring to keep it at a tempo-\nral distance.

Placed in this wider context, far from helping to keep\nthe question concerning the use of digital tools and data-led methodologies in the\nhumanities open (or having anything particularly interesting to say about theory),\nthe rejection of critical-theoretical ideas as untimely can be seen as both moraliz-\ning and conservative.\n\nIn saying this | am reiterating an argument initially made by Wendy Brown in\nthe sphere of political theory. Yet can a similar case not be made with regard to the\ncomputational turn in the humanities to the effect that the “rebuff of critical theory\nas untimely provides the core matter for the affirmative case for it’?4 Theory is vital\nfrom this point of view, not for conforming to accepted conceptions of political\ncritique that see it primarily in terms of power, ideology, race, gender, class, sexual-\nity, ecology, affect, and so forth or for sustaining conventional methods of study-\ning culture that may no longer be appropriate to the networked nature of twenty-\nfirst century postindustrial society.

We digital humanists develop tools, data, metadata, and archives critically; and\nwe have also developed critical positions on the nature of such resources (e.g., disputing\nwhether computational methods are best used for truth-finding or, as Lisa Samuels and\nJerome McGann put it, ‘deformation’). But rarely do we extend the issues involved into\nthe register of society, economics, politics, or culture in the vintage manner, for instance,\nof the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR). How the digital humani-\nties advance, channel, or resist the great postindustrial, neoliberal, corporatist, and global-\nist flows of information-cum-capital, for instance, is a question rarely heard in the digital\n\nhumanities associations, conferences, journals, and projects with which I am familiar.

Can this turn toward the sciences (if there\nhas indeed been such a turn, a question that is worthy of further examination) be\nregarded as a response on the part of the humanities to the perceived lack of credibil-\nity, if not obsolescence, of their metanarratives of legitimation: the life of the spirit\nand the Enlightenment but also Marxism, psychoanalysis, and so forth? Indeed, are\nthe sciences today to be regarded as answering many humanities questions more\nconvincingly than the humanities themselves?\n\nWhile ideas of this kind are perhaps a little bit too neat and symmetrical to be\nentirely convincing, this “scientific turn” in the humanities has been attributed by\nsome to a crisis of confidence. It is a crisis brought about, if not by the lack of cred-\nibility of the humanities metanarratives of legitimation exactly then at least in part\nby the “imperious attitude” of the sciences. This attitude has led the latter to colonize\nthe humanists’ space in the form of biomedicine, neuroscience, theories of cogni-\ntion, and so on (Kagan, 227). Is the turn toward computing just the latest manifes-\ntation of and response to this crisis of confidence in the humanities? Can we go even\nfurther and ask, is it evidence that certain parts of the humanities are attempting to\nincrease their connection to society’ and to the instrumentality and functionality\nof society especially? Can it be merely a coincidence that such a turn toward com-\nputing is gaining momentum at a time when the UK government is emphasizing\nthe importance of the STEMs (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)\nand withdrawing support and funding for the humanities? Or is one of the reasons\nall this is happening now due to the fact that the humanities, like the sciences them-\nselves, are under pressure from government, business, management, industry, and\nincreasingly the media to prove they provide value for money in instrumental, func-\ntional, performative terms? Is the interest in computing a strategic decision on the\npart of some of those in the humanities? As Dan Cohen and Fred Gibbs's project to\ntext mine “the 1,681,161 books that were published in English in the UK in the long\nnineteenth century” shows, one can get funding from the likes of Google (Cohen,\n“Searching”). In fact, in the summer of 2010 “Google awarded $1 million to pro-\nfessors doing digital humanities research” (Cohen, “Digital Keys”; see also Orwant).\n\nTo what extent, then, is the take up of practical techniques and approaches from\ncomputing science providing some areas of the humanities with a means of defend-\ning (and refreshing) themselves in an era of global economic crisis and severe cuts\nto higher education, through the transformation of their knowledge and learning\ninto quantities of information—deliverables? Can we even position the compu-\ntational turn as an event created to justify such a move on the part of certain ele-\nments within the humanities (Frabetti}? And does this mean that, if we don't simply\nwant to go along with the current movement away from what remains resistant to\na general culture of measurement and calculation and toward a concern to legiti-\nmate power and control by optimizing the system’s efficiency, we would be better\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:31 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

After all, the idea of a compu-\ntational turn implies that the humanities, thanks to the development of a new gen-\neration of powerful computers and digital tools, have somehow become digital, or\nare in the process of becoming digital, or are at least coming to terms with the digital\nand computing (Frabetti). Yet one of the things I am attempting to show by drawing\non the thought of Lyotard, Deleuze, and others is that the digital is not something\nthat can now be added to the humanities—for the simple reason that the (suppos-\nedly predigital} humanities can be seen to have already had an understanding of\nand engagement with computing and the digital.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis chapter originally appeared as “On the Limits of Openness V: There Are No Digital\nHumanities,” Media Gifts, January 12, 2011. http://www.garyhall.info/journal/2011/1/12/\non-the-limits-of-openness-v-there-are-no-digital-humanities html.\n\n1. In The Postmodern Condition, Jean-Francois Lyotard showed how science, lack-\ning the resources to legitimate itself as true, had since its beginnings with Plato relied for\nits legitimacy on precisely the kind of knowledge it did not even consider to be knowi-\nedge: nonscientific narrative knowledge. Specifically, science legitimated itself by produc-\ning a discourse called philosophy. It was philosophy’s role to generate a discourse of legit-\nimation for science. Lyotard proceeded to define as modern any science that legitimated\nitself in this way by means of a metadiscourse that explicitly appealed to a grand narrative\nof some sort: the life of the spirit, the Enlightenment, progress, modernity, the emancipa-\ntion of humanity, the realization of the Idea.\n\n2. Interestingly, for Kagan, “The scientists’ intrusions into the philosophers territory,\nwhich robbed the latter of part of their mission, forced them to find another assignment\nand many selected analyses of the coherence of the scientists’ semantic texts” (Kagan, 228).\n\n3. As Kirschenbaum writes, “Whatever else it might be then, the digital humanities\ntoday is about a scholarship (and a pedagogy) that is publicly visible in ways to which we\nare generally unaccustomed, a scholarship and pedagogy that are bound up with infra-\nstructure in ways that are deeper and more explicit than we are generally accustomed\nto, a scholarship and pedagogy that are collaborative and depend on networks of peo-\nple and that live an active 24/7 life online.

According to its website, the ASA “is\n.\n\na. the nation’s oldest and largest association devoted to the interdisciplinary study\n\njiite\n\nof American culture and history.” Over the past two decades, the ASA conference\nhas emerged as a leading venue for vibrant discussions about race, ethnicity, trans-\nnationalism, gender, and sexuality. While the ASA represents scholars with a diverse\narray of methodological approaches from a variety of disciplines, the society is a\nwelcome home to academics whose work is interpretative and theoretical. During\nthe meeting, I attended a variety of panels engaging such issues and approaches and\ncame away feeling energized and refreshed, my intellectual imagination stoked by\nthe many ways in which race and ethnicity were wielded as central terms of analy-\nsis throughout the long weekend.\n\nThe following week, I was off to Baltimore where I attended “Tools for Data-\nDriven Scholarship,” a workshop funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF),\nthe National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and\nLibrary Services. This invitation-only event was cohosted. by George Mason Uni-\nversity’s Center for History and New Media (CHNM) and the Maryland Institute\nfor Technology in the Humanities (MITH), two pioneering centers of what we have\nrecently begun to call the “digital humanities.” This workshop built upon several\nyears’ conversation (particularly following the 2003 NSF Atkins Report on cyberin-\nfrastructure) about the need for a digital infrastructure for humanities computing.\n\n \n\nThe goal of the workshop was defined in the e-mail invite as a report “that discusses\nthe needs of tools developers and users; sets forth objectives for addressing those\nneeds; proposes infrastructure for accomplishing these objectives; and makes sug-\ngestions for a possible RFP” This meeting was also lively, full of thoughtful discus-\nsions about the possibilities for (and obstacles in the way of) a robust infrastructure\nfor scholars engaged in computation and the humanities.

And, once again,\nfound myself wondering why it seemed so hard to hold together my long-standing\nacademic interests in race, gender, and certain modes of theoretical inquiry with my\nmore recent (if decade-old} immersion in the world of digital production and design.\n\nWhile the workshop I participated in at ASA was titled “American Studies at\nthe Digital Crossroads” and drew a nice crowd, the conference as a whole included\nremarkably little discussion of digital technologies (although there were some analy-\nses of digital texts such as websites and video games.) It is largely accurate, if also a\ngeneralization, to say that many in the membership of the ASA treat computation\nwithin the humanities with some level of suspicion, perceiving it to be complicit\nwith the corporatization of higher education or as primarily technological rather\nthan scholarly? (indeed, this attitude is shared by a large number of “traditional”\nhumanities scholars across any number of fields or professional societies who do\nnot work with digital media.) In a hallway chat following our workshop, one scholar\nframed his dis-ease as a question: “Why are the digital humanities, well, so white?”\nAnd while my memory is far from perfect, I think it is safe to say that the Baltimore\nworkshop included no discussion of many topics much in evidence at ASA, top-\nics including immigration, race, and neoliberalism. To be fair, this was a workshop\nfocused on the notion of tools and infrastructure, so one might not expect such\ndiscussions. Nonetheless, this essay will argue that we desperately need to close the\ngap between these two modes of inquiry. Further, I will argue that the difficulties\nwe encounter in knitting together our discussions of race (or other modes of dif-\nference) with our technological productions within the digital humanities (or in\nour studies of code) are actually an effect of the very designs of our technological\nsystems, designs that emerged in post-World War IL computational culture. These\norigins of the digital continue to haunt our scholarly engagements with comput-\ners, underwriting the ease with which we partition off considerations of race in our\nwork in the digital humanities and digital media studies.\n\nU.S. Operating Systems at Midcentury: The Intertwining of Race and UNIX\n\nLet us turn to two fragments cut from history, during the 1960s.\n\nFRAGMENT ONE\n\nIn the early 1960s, computer scientists at MIT were working on Project MAC, an\nearly set of experiments in Compatible Timesharing Systems for computing.

The project was funded by ARPA (Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency) of the Defense Department for two million dollars a year\nfor eight years. MULTICS introduced early ideas about modularity in hardware\nstructure and software architecture.\n\nIn 1969, Bell Labs stopped working on MULTICS, and that summer one of\ntheir engineers, Ken Thompson, developed the beginning of UNIX. While there are\nclearly influences of MULTICS on UNIX, the later system also moves away from\nthe earlier one, pushing for increased modularity and for a simpler design able to\nrun on cheaper computers.\n\nIn simplest terms, UNIX is an early operating system for digital computers,\none that has spawned many offshoots and clones. These include MAC OS X as well\nas LINUX, indicating the reach of UNIX over the past forty years. The system also\ninfluenced non-UNIX operating systems like Windows NT and remains in use by\nmany corporate IT divisions. UNIX was originally written in assembly language,\nbut after Thompson’s colleague Dennis Ritchie developed the C programming lan-\nguage in 1972, Thompson rewrote UNIX in that language. Basic text-formatting\nand editing features were added (i.e., early word processors). In 1974, Ritchie and\nThompson published their work in the journal of the Association for Computing\nMachinery, and UNIX began to pick up a good deal of steam.‘\n\nUNIX can also be thought of as more than an operating system, as it also\nincludes a number of utilities such as command line editors, APIs, code libraries,\nand so on. Furthermore, UNIX is widely understood to embody particular philos-\nophies and cultures of computation, “operating systems” of a larger order that we\nwill return to.\n\nFRAGMENT TWO\n\nOf course, for scholars of culture, of gender, and of race like the members of the\nASA, dates like 1965 and 1968 have other resonances. For many of us, 1965 might\nnot recall MULTICS but instead the assassination of Malcolm X, the founding of\nthe United Farm Workers, the burning of Watts, or the passage of the Voting Rights\nAct. The mid-1960s also saw the origins of the American Indian Movement (AIM)\nand the launch of the National Organization for Women (NOW). The late 1960s\nmark the 1968 citywide walkouts of Latino youth in Los Angeles, the assassina-\ntions of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert E Kennedy, the Chicago Democratic\nConvention, the Stonewall Riots, and the founding of the Black Panthers and the\nYoung Lords. Beyond the geographies of the United States, we might also remem-\nber the Prague Spring of 1968, Tommie Smith and John Carlos at the Mexico Sum-\nmer Olympics, the Tlatelolco Massacre, the execution of Che Guevara, the Chinese\nCultural Revolution, the Six-Day War, or May °68 in Paris.

Resistance to the Vietnam\nWar mounted. as the decade wore on. Abroad, movements against colonialism and\noppression were notably strong.\n\nThe history just glossed as “Fragment One” is well known to code junkies and\ncomputer geeks. Numerous websites archive oral histories, programming manuals,\nand technical specifications for MULTICS, UNIX, and various mainframe and other\nhardware systems. Key players in that history, including Ken Thompson, Donald\nRitchie, and Doug Mcliroy, have a kind of geek-chic celebrity status, and differing\nversions of the histories of software and hardware development are hotly debated,\nincluding nitty-gritty details of what really counts as “a UNIX?’ In media studies,\nemerging work in “code studies” often resurrects and takes up these histories.*\n\nWithin American, cultural, and. ethnic studies, the temporal touchstones of\nstruggles over racial justice, antiwar activism, and legal history are also widely rec-\nognized and analyzed. Not surprisingly, these two fragments typically stand apart\nin parallel tracks, attracting the interest and attention of very different audiences\nlocated in the deeply siloed departments that categorize our universities.\n\nBut why?\n\nIn short, I suggest that these two moments are deeply interdependent. In fact,\nthey coconstitute one another, comprising not independent slices of history but\ninstead related and useful lenses into the shifting epistemological registers driving\nU.S. and global culture in the 1960s and after.\n\nThis history of intertwining and mutual dependence is hard to sketch. As one\ndelves into the intricacies of UNIX (or of XML), race in America recedes far from\nour line of vision and inquiry. Likewise, detailed examinations into the shifting reg-\nisters of race and racial visibility post-1950 do not easily lend themselves to obser-\nvations about the emergence of object-oriented programming or the affordances\nof databases. Very few audiences who care about one lens have much patience or\ntolerance for the other.\n\nEarly forays into new media theory in the late 1990s and much concurrent\nwork in the computational humanities rarely helped this problem. Theorists of\nnew media often retreated into forms of analysis that Marsha Kinder has critiqued\nas “cyberstructuralist,” intent on parsing media specificity and on theorizing the\nforms of new media while disavowing twenty-plus years of critical race theory,\nfeminism, and other modes of overtly politicized inquiry. Much of the work in the\ndigital humanities also proceeded as if technologies from XML to databases were\nneutral tools.’ Many who had worked hard to instill race as a central mode of anal-\nysis in film, literary, and media studies throughout the late twentieth century were\ndisheartened and outraged (if not that surprised) to find both new media theory\nand emerging digital tools seem indifferent to those hard-won gains.\n\nEarly analyses of race and the digital often took two forms: first, a critique of\nrepresentations in new media or the building of digital archives about race, modes\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:40 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Such work rarely tied race to the anal-\nyses of form, phenomenology, or computation that were so compelling in the\nwork of Lev Manovich, Mark Hansen, or Jay Bolter and Richard. Grusin. Impor-\ntant works emerged from both “camps,” but the camps rarely intersected. A few\nevents attempted to force a collision between these areas, but the going was tough.\nFor instance, at the two Race and Digital Space Conferences colleagues and I orga-\nnized in 2000 and 2002, the vast majority of participants and speakers were engaged\nin work in the two modes mentioned earlier. The cyberstructuralists were not in\nattendance.\n\nBut what if this very incompatability is itself part and parcel of the organiza-\ntion of knowledge production that operating systems like UNIX helped to dissemi-\nnate around the world? Might we ask whether there is not something particular to\nthe very forms of electronic culture that seems to encourage just such a movement,\na movement that partitions race off from the specificity of media forms? Put dif-\nferently, might we argue that the very structures of digital computation develop at\nleast in part to cordon off race and to contain it? Further, might we come to under-\nstand that our own critical methodologies are the heirs to this epistemological shift?\n\nFrom early writings by Sherry Turkle and George Landow to more recent work\nby Alex Galloway and others, new media scholars have noted the parallels between\nthe ways of knowing modeled. in computer culture and the greatest hits of struc-\nturalism and poststructuralism. Critical race theorists and postcolonial scholars like\nChela Sandoval and Gayatri Spivak have illustrated the structuring (if unacknowl-\nedged) role that race plays in the work of poststructuralists like Roland Barthes and\nMichel Foucault. We might bring these two arguments together, triangulating race,\nelectronic culture, and poststructuralism, and, further, argue that race, particularly\nin the United States, is central to this undertaking, fundamentally shaping how we\nsee and know as well as the technologies that underwrite or cement both vision and\nknowledge. Certain modes of racial visibility and knowing coincide or dovetail with\nspecific ways of organizing data: if digital computing underwrites today’s informa-\ntion economy and is the central technology of post-World War H America, these\ntechnologized ways of seeing and knowing took shape in a world also struggling\nwith shifting knowledges about and representations of race. If, as Michael Omi and\nHoward Winant argue, racial formations serve as fundamental organizing prin-\nciples of social relations in the United States, on both the macro and micro levels\n(55), how might we understand the infusion of racial organizing principles into the\ntechnological organization of knowledge after World War I?\n\nOmi and Winant and other scholars have tracked the emergence of a “race-\nblind” rhetoric at midcentury, a discourse that moves from overt to more covert\nmodes of racism and racial representation (e.g., from the era of Jim Crow to lib-\neral colorblindness).

The viewer can\nrotate the card to see any single image, but the lens itself makes seeing the images\ntogether very difficult, even as it conjoins them at a structural level (Le., within the\nsame card). In the post~civil rights United States, the lenticular is a way of organiz-\ning the world. It structures representations but also epistemologies. It also serves\nto secure our understandings of race in very narrow registers, fixating on sameness\nor difference while forestalling connection and interrelation. As I have argued else-\nwhere, we might think of the lenticular as a covert mode of the pretense of separate\nbut equal, remixed for midcentury America (McPherson, 250).\n\nA lenticular logic is a covert racial logic, a logic for the post~civil rights era.

The popularity of lenticular lenses, particularly in the form\nof postcards, coincides historically not just with the rise of an articulated movement\nfor civil rights but also with the growth of electronic culture and the birth of digital\ncomputing (with both—digital computing and the civil rights movement—born in\nquite real ways of World War I). We might understand UNIX as the way in which\nthe emerging logics of the lenticular and of the covert racism of color blindness get\nported into our computational systems, both in terms of the specific functions of\nUNIX as an operating system and in the broader philosophy it embraces.\n\nSITUATING UNIX\n\nIn moving toward UNIX from MULTICS, programmers conceptualized UNIX as a\nkind of tool kit of “synergistic parts” that allowed “flexibility in depth” (Raymond,\n9). Programmers could “choose among multiple shells. ... [and] programs normally\nprovide[d] many behavior options” (6). One of the design philosophies driving\nUNIX is the notion that a program should do one thing and do it weil (not unlike\nour deep disciplinary drive in many parts of the university); this privileging of the\ndiscrete, the local, and the specific emerges again and again in discussions of UNIX’s\norigins and design philosophies.\n\nBooks for programmers that explain the UNIX philosophy revolve around a\ncommon set of rules. While slight variations on this rule set exist across program-\nming books and online sites, Eric Raymond sets out the first nine rules as follows:\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:40 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

For instance, Brian Kernighan wrote in a 1976 handbook on software\nprogramming that “controlling complexity is the essence of computer program-\nming” (quoted in Raymond, 14). Complexity in UNIX is controlled in part by the\nRule of Modularity, which insists that code be constructed of discrete and inter-\nchangeable parts that can be plugged together via clean interfaces. In Design Rules,\nVol. 1: The Power of Modularity, Carliss Baldwin and Kim Clark argue that comput-\ners from 1940 to 1960 had “complex, interdependent designs,” and they label this era\nthe “premodular” phase of computing (149). While individuals within the industry,\nincluding John von Neumann, were beginning to imagine benefits to modularity in\ncomputing, Baldwin and Clark note that von Neumann’s ground-breaking designs\nfor computers in that period “fell short of true modularity” because “in no sense\nwas the detailed design of one component going to be hidden from the others: all\npieces of the system would be produced ‘in full view’ of the others” (157). Thus one\nmight say that these early visions of digital computers were neither modular nor\nlenticular. Baldwin and Clark track the increasing modularity of hardware design\nfrom the early 1950s forward and also observe that UNIX was the first operating\nsystem to embrace modularity and adhere “to the principles of information hid-\ning” in its design (324).\n\nThere are clearly practical advantages of such structures for coding, but they\nalso underscore a worldview in which a troublesome part might be discarded with-\nout disrupting the whole. Tools are meant to be “encapsulated” to avoid “a tendency\nto involve programs with each others’ internals” (Raymond, 15). Modules “don’t\npromiscuously share global data,’ and problems can stay “local” (8485).

UNIX is meant to allow mul-\ntitasking, portability, time sharing, and compartmentalizing. It is not much of a\nstretch to layer these traits over the core tenets of post-Fordism, a mode of produc-\ntion that begins to remake industrial-era notions of standardization in the 1960s:\ntime-space compression, transformability, customization, a public/private blur,\nand so on. UNIX’s intense modularity and information-hiding capacity were rein-\nforced by its design—that is, in the ways in which it segregated the kernel from the\nshell. The kernel loads into the computer’s memory at start-up and is “the heart” of\nUNIX (managing “hardware memory, job execution, and time sharing”), although\nit remains hidden from the user (Baldwin and Clark, 332). The shells (or programs\nthat interpret commands) are intermediaries between the user and the computer's\ninner workings. They hide the details of the operating system from the user behind\n“the shell,” extending modularity from a rule for programming in UNIX to the very\ndesign of UNIX itself.°\n\nModularity in the Social Field\n\nThis push toward modularity and the covert in digital computation also reflects\nother changes in the organization of social life in the United States by the 1960s.\nFor instance, if the first half of the twentieth century laid bare its racial logics, from\n“Whites Only” signage to the brutalities of lynching, the second half increasingly\nhides its racial “kernel, burying it below a shell of neoliberal pluralism. These covert\nracial logics take hold at the tail end of the civil rights movement at least partially\nto cut off and contain the more radical logics implicit in the urban uprisings that\nshook Detroit, Watts, Chicago, and Newark. In fact, the urban center of Detroit\nwas more segregated by the 1980s than in previous decades, reflecting a different\ninflection of the programmer’s vision of the “easy removal” or containment of a\ntroubling part. Whole areas of the city might be rendered orthogonal and dispos-\nable (also think post-Katrina New Orleans), and the urban black poor were increas-\ningly isolated in “deteriorating city centers” (Sugrue, 198). Historian Thomas Sug-\nrue traces the increasing unemployment rates for black men in Detroit, rates that\nrose dramatically from the 1950s to the 1980s, and maps a “deproletarianization”\nthat “shaped a pattern of poverty in the postwar city that was surprisingly new”\n(262).

These strategies also\nplayed out in ongoing reorganizations of the political field throughout the 1960s\nand. 1970s in both the Right and the Left. The widespread divestiture in the infra-\nstructure of inner cities can be seen as one more insidious effect of the logic of\nmodularity in the postwar era. But we might also understand the emergence of\nidentity politics in the 1960s as a kind of social and political embrace of modular-\nity and encapsulation, a mode of partitioning that turned away from the broader\nforms of alliance-based and globally inflected political practice that characterized\nboth labor politics and antiracist organizing in the 1930s and 1940s.'! While identity\npolitics produced concrete gains in the world, particularly in terms of civil rights,\nwe are also now coming to understand the degree to which these movements cur-\ntailed and short-circuited more radical forms of political praxis, reducing struggle\nto fairly discrete parameters.\n\nLet me be clear.

Rather, 1 am highlighting the ways in which the organiza-\ntion of information and capital in the 1960s powerfully responds—across many\nregisters—to the struggles for racial justice and democracy that so categorized the\nUnited States at the time. Many of these shifts were enacted in the name of liberal-\nism, aimed at distancing the overt racism of the past even as they contained and cor-\ndoned off progressive radicalism. The emergence of covert racism and its rhetoric of\ncolor blindness are not so much intentional as systemic.

He attributes this particular tendency in literary criticism at least\nin part to the triumph of a managerial impulse, a turn that we might also align\n(even if Newfield doesn’t) with the workings of modular code (itself studied as an\nexemplary approach to dynamic modeling systems for business management in the\nwork of Baldwin and Clark cited earlier.) He observes as well that this managerial\nobsession within literary criticism exhibits a surprising continuity across the 1960s\nand beyond. Gerald Graff has also examined the “patterned isolation” that emerges\nin the university after World War IL, at the moment when New Criticism’s meth-\nods take hold in a manner that deprivileges context and focuses on “explication for\nexplication’s sake.” Graff then analyzes the routinization of literary criticism in the\nperiod, a mechanistic exercise with input and output streams of its own (227). He\nrecognizes that university departments (his example is English) begin to operate\nby a field-based and modular strategy of “coverage,” in which subfields proliferate\nand exist in their own separate chunks of knowledge, rarely contaminated by one\nanother's “internals” (250). (He also comments that this modular strategy includes\nthe token hiring of scholars of color who are then cordoned off within the depart-\nment.) Graff locates the beginning of this patterned isolation in the run-up to the\nperiod that also brought us digital computing; he writes that it continues to play\nout today in disciplinary structures that have become increasingly narrow and spe-\nclalized. Patterned isolation begins with the bureaucratic standardization of the\nuniversity from 1890 through 1930 (61-62), but this “cut out and separate” men-\ntality reaches a new crescendo after World War I] as the organizational structure of\nthe university pushes from simply bureaucratic and Taylorist to managerial, a shift\nnoted as well by Christopher Newfield. Many now lament the overspecialization of\nthe university; in effect, this tendency is a result of the additive logic of the lenticular\nor of the pipeline, where “content areas” or “fields” are tacked together without any\nsense of intersection, context, or relation. Today, we risk adding the digital humani-\nties to our proliferating disciplinary menus without any meaningful and substantial\nengagement with fields such as gender studies or critical race theory.\n\nIt is interesting to note that much of the early work performed in UNIX envi-\nronments was focused on document processing and communication tools and that\nUNIX is a computational system that very much privileges text (it centers on the\ntext-based command line instead of on the graphical user interface, and its inputs\nand. outputs are simple text lines).

And, because\ndigital media were born as much of the civil rights era as of the cold war era (and\nof course these eras are one and the same), our investigations must incorporate\nrace from the outset, understanding and theorizing its function as a ghost in the\ndigital machine.

If the study of repre-\nsentation may in fact be part and parcel of the very logic of modularity that such\ncode inaugurates, a kind of distraction, it is equally plausible to argue that our very\nintense focus on visuality in the past twenty years of scholarship is just a different\nmanifestation of the same distraction. There is tendency in film and media studies\nto treat the computer and its screens as (in Jonathan Beller’s terms) a “legacy” tech-\nnology to cinema.

We must take seriously the question, why are the\ndigital humanities so white? but also ask why American studies is not more digital.\n\nWe must remember that computers are themselves encoders of culture. If, in\nthe 1960s and 1970s, UNIX hardwired an emerging system of covert racism into\nour mainframes and our minds, then computation responds to culture as much as\nit controls it. Code and race are deeply intertwined, even as the structures of code\nlabor to disavow these very connections.” Politically committed academics with\nhumanities skill sets must engage technology and its production not simply as an\nobject of our scorn, critique, or fascination but as a productive and generative space\nthat is always emergent and never fully determined.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. For the past decade, I have had the privilege to work with a team of collaborators\non a variety of digital projects, including the online journal Vectors and a new authoring\nplatform Scalar.

These tensions between traditional humanities scholars and computational\nhumanists are, of course, not new. For examples of these dynamics within early waves of\nhumanities computing, see Thomas, “Computing and the Historical Imagination,” and\nCraig, “Stylistic Analysis and Authorship Studies.” As these authors note from within the\nrealms of authorship studies and historical studies, these tensions often played out over\nthe differences between quantitative and qualitative analysis and via debates on the sta-\ntus and validity of various modes of interpretation.

UNIX develops with some rapidity at least in part because the parent company of\nBell Labs, AT&T, was unable to enter the computer business due to a 1958 consent decree.\nEric Raymond notes that “Bell Labs was required to license its nontelephone technology\nto anyone who asked” (33). Thus a kind of counterculture chic developed around UNIX.\nRaymond provides a narrative version of this history, including the eventual UNIX wars,\nin his The Art of UNIX Programming. His account, while thorough, tends to romanticize\nthe collaborative culture around UNIX. For a more objective analysis of the imbrications\n\nof the counterculture and early computing cultures, see Fred Turner’s From Countercul-\n\n \n\nture to Cyberculture.

Some scholars have questioned the neutral status of digital structures such as\ncode and databases. John Unsworth has situated UNIX as a Western cultural formation,\narguing that “UNIX is deeply indebted to culturally determined notions such as private\nproperty, class membership, and hierarchies of power and effectivity. Most of these ideas\nare older than the modern Western culture that produced UNIX, but the constellation of\ncultural elements gathered together in UNIX’s basic operating principles seems particu-\nlarly Western and capitalist—-not surprisingly, given that its creators were human exten-\nsions of one of the largest accumulations of capital in the Western world” (142). See also\nDavid Golumbia’s observations on the limits of the database and of semantic computing\nfor humanities analysis, as well as work on culturally contextual databases and ontologies\n\nundertaken by Kimberly Christen and Ramesh Srinivasan. Golumbia has further argued\n\n  \n\nthat object-oriented programming privileges categorization and hierarchies in a man-\n\n \n\nner that has “much more to do with engineering presumptions and ideologies than with\ncomputational efficiency” (209). His work is a must read for anyone caught up in utopian\nreadings of digital culture’s empowering and participatory aspects.\n\n7. In comments on a draft of this essay, Steve Ramsay suggested that Mike Gancarz’s\nThe Unix Philosophy categorizes UNIX viaa related but different rule set.

Is this a problem if it means that there will be\neditions that are in fact collections of full variant texts with no selected or edited\nreading text? This paper argues that both archival editions with digital fac-\nsimiles and encoded source texts (digital diplomatic editions) and digital\ncritical texts can and must exist side by side. It is also suggested that from high\nquality diplomatically encoded source texts it is possible to automatically\nextract texts that either directly or with some further encoding/editing can\nfunction as a base text for editions of different types and which build on\ndifferent editorial philosophies. The editions produced at the Wittgenstein\nArchives in Bergen and in the project Henrik Ibsen’s Writings in Oslo are used\nas examples of projects supporting the author’s arguments.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn a recent paper Peter Robinson argues against a belief he claims to have\nseen, proposing that computers and hypertext make it possible to publish\nall variants and versions of a text, and that this would free the editor of\nmaking the choices which an editor traditionally had to make regarding\ntext selection, editing etc. (Robinson, 2002). Against this simplistic belief\nin the use of computers and mass digitization Robinson adds a list of\nproposed requirements? that should be fulfilled in order to produce what\nhe considers a critical digital edition.\n\nIt is not clear from Robinson’s paper if he only considers worthwhile\neditions which can be classified as critical digital editions according to his\npropositions. There are reasons against such a view. At a conference\norganized by the Editing Medieval Manuscripts research group at the\nCentre for Advanced Studies at the Norwegian Academy of Science and\nLetters’ research programme in April 2001, Mar Jonsson presented what\nhe called ‘editorial impotence’ (Mar, 2001)*. In his paper he claims that\none of the reasons why the number of published editions of Norse medi-\neval texts per year seems to be reduced is the requirement for scholarly\nwork expected in the introduction.

An adjusted version of this diagram shows other possible\nrelationships between edition types.* (Fig. 1)\n\nThe HIW project illustrates how results or editions from one project\ncan be reused as building blocks for another editorial project. All known\n(and available) manuscripts by Henrik Ibsen were scanned in a project at\nthe Ibsen Centre at the University of Oslo (Eide, 2000). This collection of\ndigital facsimiles with a certain amount of metadata linked with the\nfacsimiles is in itself an edition, at least according to Tanselle’s classifi-\ncation system. The HIW project uses these facsimiles as their primary\nsource for transcriptions. Only where something is not exactly clear from\nthe facsimile are the original manuscripts consulted (if possible).?\n\nAt what was then the Norwegian Computing Centre for the Human-\nities at the University of Bergen, the dramatic and lyric texts by Henrik\nIbsen as they were published in the so called Centennial critical Ibsen\nedition were transcribed with the aim of producing a lemmatized and\ngrammatically tagged concordance of Ibsen’s works (Noreng, Hofland\nand Natvig, 1987). As a spin-off from this project, the dramas and poems\nfrom the Centennial edition are available and can be searched at the\nUniversity of Bergen’s web pages.'® This is in itself also one type of\nedition. But the encoded material was also given to the HIW project\nwhere these texts gave the HIW a flying start in its work on transcribing\nand encoding the printed Ibsen editions.\n\nThe HIW project is thus reusing data from two other projects, the\nfacsimile project at the University of Oslo and the concordance project at\nthe Norwegian Computing Centre for the Humanities. The facsimiles are\nused for data entry and encoding—the originals are not collected in any\none single place or country.\n\nThe HIW aims at producing critical editions of the complete works of\nHenrik Ibsen. But will these critical editions be the project’s product with\nthe longest lifetime for usefulness?

For Nordic medieval texts a new\ntype of text archive has been established: The Medieval Nordic Text\nArchive. MENOTA has member institutions from Denmark, Iceland,\nNorway and Sweden. The MENOTA Handbook (MENOTA, 2003) pro-\nvides guidelines for transcriptions and text encoding.

This type of organization\nmakes it possible to provide texts for other scholars before there is a\ndigital critical edition and in many cases a scholar, for instance a historian\n(to return to Mar Jénsson (2001)) will be more helped by having a\ntranscription with a certain amount of mark-up available than if he or\nshe would have to wait another twenty years for a digital critical edition.\n\nIn Robinson’s (2002) paper, one can get the impression that unless\none produces a critical digital edition one is actually doing nothing of\nintellectual and scholarly value but just ‘magically’ adding in texts and\nimages to some kind of computer storage. In a paper given at a con-\nference in Stockholm (Ore, 1999), I gave an early version of some of the\nideas appearing here. One of the comments in the discussion after the\npresentation was that I was suggesting the kind of textual criticism that\ncould be performed by trained monkeys, that unless an editorial project\nincluded text selection and emendation, without the critical edition there\n\noo, . was no work of scholarly value.

In some cases\nthis mark-up is not explicit, for instance when we look at texts where\nchapter headlines might be written in bold and in another typeface than\nthe running text. But once we look further into this we realize that this is\nalso a kind of mark-up, and in a digital edition there will also be some\nexplicit encoding hidden behind the bold text. In this example the reason\nsomething is shown as bold is that the publisher (or, as the case may be,\nthe reader) has chosen to display chapter headlines this way. This is the\nabstraction level intended when SGML was introduced and very clearly\ndescribed when the Text Encoding Initiative launched the P3 Guidelines\nin 1994, (Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen, 1994). In a text or a docu-\nment some part might be encoded in start- and end-tags and the choice\nof tag might identify some kind of property the editor or encoder claims\nhas a certain value for this part. This might for instance be that this word\nhas been overstruck or deleted by the writer. There might also be single,\nempty tags which contain information valid at this part of the text (for\ninstance the insertion point for a footnote or a line break might be\nmarked). Here is an example from a tagged manuscript transcription:\n\n<lb/>forferdet da jeg oppdaget a?<note type=”transkr”>av?\n</note> <name  type=\"person”>fru Hills</name> grav\n(Smith, 1954-55, p. 100)\n\n   \n\nIn this text extract <Ib/> marks a line break. <note>...</note> gives\ntwo pieces of information: the start-tag (<note>) is placed at a certain\npoint in the text where there might be for instance a footnote mark in one\nview. The start/end-tags surround the content of the note. (In this case a\nworking note about the transcription.) Similarly the <name>...</name>\ntags surround a part of the text and the encoder uses these tags to make a\nclaim about the content. Later processing may for instance use this to\ncreate an index of person names if this should be printed.\n\nFrom the idea of a footnote it is not much of a leap to imagine the\nencoding marking the start or end of a hypertext link. From this\ndescription we might go one step further: there really isn’t any difference\n\nbetween inline mark-up and hypertext, it is only a matter of the abstrac- 12 Some commercial software\ntion level we are working at and of the tools available for our editing. systems such as Panorama\nHypertext has so far not developed into general systems for every- and before that Dynabook\none.’ Instead some of the features expected in ‘real’ hypertext, such as could store notes and\nlinks from one place to another, are available in a more simplified form in comments as external texts\n\nfor instance web document mark-up (html) and web protocols (http). with links into the\n\nAlso we find that the linking information is usually hard coded as part of\na text’s mark-up and this mark-up is again usually embedded as part of\na document.

I will not discuss for instance micropayment\nsystems here (but these are crucial for Nelson’s model). But a develop-\nment towards external encoding would give digital editions a longer life.\nA correctly (as far as possible) transcribed text witness may then be\nencoded with layers of encoding, and these codes need not necessarily be\nstored in the same text file—or even file system—as the encoded text—a\nsolution known as offset mark-up that is proposed, and used, by a\nnumber of projects, one of which will be described below. (This would\nalso make it possible to encode texts on read-only media and stored\noutside of catalogues where the scholar has writing access.) Emendations\nof the transcribed text may, at least for a time, also be stored as parts of\nthe external links or tags—in this way variants of a text witness which\nhave been used for scholarly work may be preserved. The idea of external\nmark-up is implemented in the Just In Time Markup (JITM) system\ndescribed in a paper at the ACH/ALLC 2003 Conference (Tiffin et al.,\n2003). The JITM uses proprietary tools for a particular computer system.\nIn the not so distant future my hope is that such a system can be run on\nany web server along with the necessary tools for showing selected tag sets\nfor a given text. For if everyone can tag a text according to her or his\nwishes and scholarly level of competence, it is not given that a reader may\nwish to see a text in a view reflecting all these tags. The JITM system\ndescribed by Tiffin et al. (2003) also has features for displaying infor-\nmation from certain parts of the complete mark-up. Similar selective\ndisplay systems can of course also be made with embedded mark-up and\nthe use of namespaces/style sheets, but this opens up far more complex\nissues which I will not elaborate here except for mentioning them: should\nwe ideally be able to select certain sets of tags from a certain selection of\nencoders (when we have multiple encodings)?\n\n   \n\n5 Propositions for Text and Facsimile Archives\n\nPeter Robinson (2002) offers six propositions for critical digital editions;\nEdward Vanhoutte on the other hand offers six criteria for what defines\nan ‘electronical (scholarly) edition’:\n\n1. the immediate result or some kind of spin-off product from textual\nscholarship, 2. which is intended for a specific audience and designed\naccording to project-specific purposes, 3. which represents at least one\nversion of the text or the work, 4. which has been processed from a\nplatform-independent and non-proprietary basis that is both stored for\narchival purposes and is made available for further research (Open\nSource Policy), 5. whose creation is documented as part of the edition,\n13 Nelson (1986) and in other and 6. whose editorial status is explicitly articulated in the edition\nworks.

Ore\n\nTo this I would like to suggest certain requirements for the basic\narchives\" rather than for the museums (to follow Vanhoutte’s termin-\nology in an earlier paper (1999) ):\n\n(1) The documents in the archive should have a known source\n(<sourceDesc> in TEI) This feature is missing in for instance the\nProject Gutenberg (2003) text collection and is one of the reasons\nwhy this collection is not a functioning text archive.\n\n(2) The documents’ genesis should be documented. For digital facsimiles\nthis would include the techniques used for photographing and/or\nscanning and information about possible post-scanning processing\nof the image files. For texts, transcription work and encoding\n(including proofreading) should be documented.\n\n(3) The documents should be sufficiently described: for images this\nwould include resolution and file type. For texts I would expect\ncharacter set information and description of any possible explicit\nencoding scheme in addition to file type information. Ideally this\ndescription should be complete enough to allow future users to\nextract and read or in other ways manipulate the documents.\n\nArchives may also move on from basic archives in the direction of\nmuseums (again in Vanhoutte’s terminology) if they:\n\n(4) Offer editing tools and make it possible for users to mark up texts.\nThis mark-up should include text emendation, allowing users to\nproduce scholarly editions. But it is important that the creation of an\narchive is done as a goal in itself, not as a step in the creation of an\nedition. The archive should be a possible data source for zero or more\neditions.\n\n   \n\n6 But What about the Edition?\n\nIn Vanhoutte’s (1999) model of archives and museums, the edition\nshould handle the museum functions, and present an exhibition based\non material stored in the archive. This is similar to my own earlier\nsuggestions (Ore, 1999). But facsimile editions are not unknown, and\nneither are diplomatic editions. In fact, the boxes in Fig. 1 represent\ndifferent types of editions. In addition to the critical edition in this figure\nwe may add other types of (subjective) editions, ie. the museum exhib-\nitions discussed by Vanhoutte. The WAB has encoded the texts for a\ndiplomatic edition. This may be considered an edition belonging to the\narchive functions. But the WAB has also encoded the texts for normal-\nization and this brings them over to the museum part of Vanhoutte’s\nmodel. In the HIW project the texts are first encoded for a diplomatic\nedition—archive building—and are then later used by the philological\neditor creating a reading text for the text critical edition—the museum\n\n14 So far I have mentioned texts\nand digital facsimiles, but an\narchive might also include\n\nexhibition. The word ‘archive’ may in itself make a problem. The HIW other types of data: sound\nproduces an archive of encoded texts by Henrik Ibsen—this can also be recordings, movies,\nconsidered an edition.

As with so many disciplin-\n\nary practices, the answer to the “what is” question is likely to be legion. And as Mat-\nthew Kirschenbaum has noted in a recent ADE Bulletin article, defining DH has\nbecome something of a genre essay. But contrary to any suggestion that the defini-\ntion is settled or has been fully explored, the rising number of conference presenta-\ntions along with the surplus of writings on the topic would suggest that many see\nthe question as somehow crucial. Indeed, the significant rise in discourse around the\nquestion “What is DH?” reveals, | would suggest, not only a certain angst about the\nconstitution of the field, a not-so-unconscious uneasiness on the part of the prac-\ntitioners, but a recognition that DH has become a significant force discursively and\neconomically within the institution.\n\nEstablishing a definition by asking after the essence of something seems a futile\nproject.

In an effort to create a picture of what it is that DH scholars actually\ndo, practitioners write about what scholarly (and sometimes not so scholarly) activi-\nties they engage in throughout the day.

As such, the textual corpus produced on this day, while not a\ndefinite answer to the question of what is DH, serves as an important representa-\ntive sampling of how it is that a group of scholars who self-identify as DH practi-\ntioners talk about their work. The text produced on this day represents an inclusive\nexample, not a restrictive one, of how it is people talk—or more precisely, write—\nabout what it means to “do DH.”\n\nUnfortunately, though, with such a large sampling, it would be difficult to\nclosely read all of the essays listed on the Day of DH website, which is to say noth-\ning of the material and conversations produced via other means not archived on the\nofficial Day of DH website. Reading all of this material would indeed be a Sisyph-\nean task, whereby any close engagement would necessarily yield numerous other\ntexts that would have to be read, a black hole to be sure. Luckily, however, digital\nhumanists have provided us with computational tools that enable a more efficient\n\n \n\nreading practice, textual analysis tools that look for frequency of word use across\na large textual corpus, saving us the task of actually having to read the entire body\nof work. So rather than engaging in a close reading of what practitioners actually\nwrote, it is possible and certainly more convenient to use a computer to aid in the\nreading process.\n\nThe data that such an analysis yields is, as with many such projects, largely pre-\ndictable, indeed largely knowable without the use of a computer. The most frequent\nwords by far are digital, humanities, day, and work. Again, not surprising, given that\nthese are the terms that frame the discussion: what a day looks like for those who\nwork in the digital humanities. But the next level of words with high frequency are\nrevealing, if mostly predictable: research, design, project, data, text (and its vari-\nants such as textual), and tool(s), which is to suggest that people who identify as\nDH practitioners see themselves as designing and building tools and projects that\ndeal with text and data, producing text and data about said text and data. Perhaps,\ntellingly, all of these words have a higher occurrence than “reading” and “writing.”\n\nNone of this is particularly surprising, though; it merely reinforces a sense that\nmany scholars have already articulated: digital humanities is largely, or primarily,\nabout using computing technologies as tools to do traditional humanities-based\nresearch. One could, I suspect, perform this type of textual analysis on a range of\nsources producing similar results. The Digital Humanities Conference programs,\nBlackwell's A Companion to Digital Humanities, or even the recipients of National\nEndowment for the Humanities (NEH) funding would all present a similar distri-\n\n \n\nbution of words and conversations. This is not to make an evaluative claim (at least\nnot yet) but simply to make an observational one: those who identify their work as\ndigital humanities primarily talk about using computers to do humanities research.\n\nIndeed, there is a strong connection between digital humanities and humanities\ncomputing.

As his essay goes on to argue, the term “digital humanities”\nitself is a (rebranding of the term “humanities computing,” specifically chosen by\nBlackwell’s book project and later, perhaps crucially, as Kirschenbaum suggests,\nwith respect to the formation of the NEH Office of the Digital Humanities. What\nKirschenbaum illustrates is how the term “digital humanities” was a strategic choice\nmade by several key players. It is these events that serve as one of the focal points\nfor Kirschenbaum’s essay, as he argues that they will “earn a place in histories of the\nprofession alongside major critical movements like the Birmingham School or Yale\ndeconstruction” (4). And this, ultimately, is what is at stake in the “what is DH?”\ndebate. Digital humanities has become “something of a movement,” indeed per-\nhaps the next big movement in humanities-based scholarship (4). As scholars look\nto define what it is that constitutes the movement, and by extension what it is that\nis not part of the movement, “digital humanities” comes to serve as a rather deft\nswitch from the phrase “humanities computing,” stressing that humanities remains\nthe focus, the next moment in a continuum of scholarship rather than a rupture\nwith the past.\n\nConsider the fact that we do not have “pencil humanists” or “typewriter human-\nists.” This might seem like an odd observation, but we should ask what the adjective\n“digital” is doing in “digital humanities.” As the earlier introductory word-frequency\nanalysis suggests, what digital humanists mean by “digital humanities” is not that\nthey use computers to write or read humanities-based texts; rather, a digital human-\nities scholar uses digital devices to perform critical and theoretical observations that\nare not possible with traditional pencil or typewriter aided analysis. That is, com-\nputers and by extension the digital enable a new critical lens for understanding tra-\nditional humanistic subjects of inquiry, a lens not available prior to the invention of\ncomputing technologies. At this point we do not even have to distinguish between\nthe people who make tools for this type of analysis and those who use these tools\nfor analysis. The defining feature is the relation of a digital tool to the scholarship\nbeing performed.\n\nIn the same way that the Birmingham School or Yale deconstruction opened\nup new ways of critiquing texts not possible prior to their inception, computers\ninaugurate a school of critique, a new series of tools through which we can analyze\ntexts. This is to say nothing of the relative significance of any of these movements but\nrather to point out that all of them see themselves as movements, as ways of critiqu-\ning and analyzing texts that illustrate or reveal textual meaning in a way previously\nunavailable prior to the invention of their particular methodologies.

In many\nrespects, this works to describe any one of a number of methodological approaches\nto the humanities. A Venn diagram with the feminism school as one circle, humani-\nties another, and their overlap constitutes a humanities scholar who practices femi-\nnist humanism—or similarly Marxism as one circle, humanities as another, con-\nstitutes Marxist humanities scholarship. This is often how scholars describe their\nendeavors: “I work at the intersection of computing, feminism, and eighteenthth-\ncentury writing.”\n\nOn the whole, this version of the digital humanities treats the digital as an\nadjective, a word that modifies the unchanged notion of the humanities, leaving the\ncore of what happens unaltered, instead updating the means by which it is done. It\nmakes humanities relevant in the age of computing and demonstrates that human-\nists, too, can use computers to do better, more elaborate projects; deal with large\ndata sets; count word occurrences; and produce interesting textual visualizations.\nIn this sense, the rhetorical shift from humanities computing—humanities as the\nadjective that modifies computing, humanities as a way of computing—to digital\nhumanities, the digital as a way of doing humanities, seems rather predictable. It is\nboth more descriptive of actual practice and less threatening to traditional human-\nistic scholars. Using computers to engage in more efficient textual analysis does little\nto disrupt the framing values and ideals of the field; rather, it merely allows them to\nbe accomplished on a larger scale and at a faster pace.\n\nIn this respect, digital humanists talk about the digital as something added to\nthe humanities, a supplement to the existing scholarly paradigm. The question in\nthis type of scholarship is how the digital can be used. to enhance, reframe, or illu-\nminate scholarship that is already done or, in some cases, how the digital can do it\nmore efficiently. While texts become data and word frequency counts substitute for\nsentence-level analysis, the goal remains markedly the same: a hermeneutics of the\ntext meant to discern what it is a text (or a large corpora of texts) means.\n\nThis all suggests that there is a nondigital humanities—a humanities unaffected\nby the digital. This comes to be a rather problematic claim when we realize that\nthe digital has so altered the academic culture that there are relatively few scholarly\nactivities that are not already significantly altered by the digital. Almost all scholars\nat this point use computers rather than typewriters and use e-mail to converse with\ncolleagues dispersed around the globe. Library card catalogs have been replaced by\ncomputer searches, and journal articles are often available only by electronic means.\nThe practice of the humanities, of the academy as a whole (certainly within the\nAmerican and European contexts), is thoroughly integrated with the digital and is,\nat this point, impossible to separate from it.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:45 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "The Digital Humanities or a Digital Humanism\n\nBut for the most part, epistemological claims of large data sets notwithstanding,\nthe digital has done little to alter the structure of the humanities. Digital humanities\nnow means that one can build tools to read texts and produce data—for instance,\nto design a tool as part of a project to study eighteenth-century manuscripts—but\nthe work of the humanities scholar remains largely unchanged by the existence of\nthe computational device. The digital is a means to do what has always been done,\na means to do it more efficiently and better, but still to do what has always been\ndone. To be sure, the incorporation of the digital has led to the emergence of more\nvaried scholarly writing practices, such as the ability to have multimodal scholarly\nwriting that incorporates images and sound within a work. However, I still see this\nwork along a continuum of academic writing, rather than work that marks any\n\n \n\nsort of significant rupture: using the new to do more of the same. I think the speed\n\n \n\nat which the digital humanities have been so easily incorporated into humanities\nprograms—Kirschenbaum notes that the transition from term of convenience to\nwhole scale movement was less than five years—should give us pause. It certainly\nsuggests that the digital humanities are not all that transformative and certainly\nnot a threat to the business of humanities departments or the university as a whole.\n\nThis is not to suggest that there are not some significant and interesting proj-\nects being done under the banner of DH both within and outside of academia but\nrather that a great deal of what is being done, what is seen as central and representa-\ntive of digital humanities scholarship, does little to question the founding principles\nof academic knowledge, again, especially within the humanities. A digital human-\nism that replaces an ivory tower of bricks and mortar with one of supercomputers\nand server farms crunching large amounts of textual data and producing more and\nmore textual analysis simply replaces one form of isolationism with another, rein-\nscribing and reenforcing a very conservative form of humanities-based scholarship.\n\nNow, we could juxtapose this digital humanism to another, the one not repre-\nsented in the textual analysis of the Day of DH that began this essay. Tellingly, there\nare a group of words that appear less frequently in scholars’ posts about the digi-\ntal humanities, ones often associated with the digital and the humanities that are,\nnonetheless, significantly less represented, in some place all together absent. Social\nmedia, video games, or even contemporary web services and objects are signifi-\ncantly underrepresented. Even popular services such as Facebook or Twitter have a\nrelatively low occurrence and, when mentioned, often are used in the context refer-\nring to using the service rather than studying the tool. The most popular word used\nwith either of these two services is “checked,” indicating that they are referenced as\na medium of communication and not a medium of study.\n\nAnd so, there are at least two digital humanisms: one that sees the digital as a\n\n \n\n \n\nset of tools to be applied to humanistic inquiry (design, project, tools, data) and\nanother that sees the digital as an object of study (social media, digital games, mobile\ncomputing).

Indeed, it is in the group that\nasks humanities-oriented questions about computing technologies, where Kathleen\nplaces her own work, that I would also include mine. And so here we have two ver-\nsions (under one definition), sometimes in conflict, over what constitutes the digi-\ntal humanities. The first is the sense that the digital is a direct, almost practical use\nof computational means for research in the humanities: computer-enabled reading.\nThe second invokes scholars who study media or, more popularly, “new media” (a\nsomewhat problematic term as “new media” is neither new nor media).\n\nGiven what the data reveals about how people who identify as digital human-\nists talk about their work, given what is included in journals and conferences under\nthe rubric of “digital humanities, the first definition appears to be carrying the\nday-——that is, that the digital humanities I have been discussing for the majority of\nthis essay, the one that sees the computational as a tool for doing humanities-based\nresearch, is becoming the privileged term, with the media studies version of the\ndigital humanities serving a marginal role. As much as the “big tent” definition and\nnarrative is iterated, the practice of what actually occurs points to a different reality.\n\nNow, I could argue that this type of polarity or conflict, between a digital\nhumanism of computational technologies as adjectival modification of humani-\nties research trumping a digital humanities of humanities-based research into the\ndigital, is an unfortunate academic development. Indeed, it seems to me that the\ndominant type of digital humanism privileges the old at the expense of the new,\neven while it brings computational technologies into humanities buildings. And,\npersonally, I find the first form of digital humanism, well, frankly, rather boring. I\nam not really interested in scholarship that counts word occurrence in Jane Aus-\nten texts, or even word occurrence across all the texts written in the same year as\nAusten’s. While Ngram viewers might illuminate certain interesting, up until now\nunnoticed statistical trends regarding word usage and ultimately, perhaps, cultural\nmeaning, if they become the paradigmatic example of what it means to perform a\nhumanities reading, I fear not only for the future relevance of the humanities but\nalso for our ability to resist being easily replaced by Watson-style computers. (There\nis nothing particularly new here. Italo Calvino imagined just such a computational\nreading practice in If on a Winter’s Night a Traveler far before the instance of any\nhumanities-based computing.) If using computational technologies to perform text\nanalysis becomes just the latest way to make humanities exciting and relevant, to\nargue for funding, to beg not to be eliminated from the university, then DH will\nsoon also go the way of any number of other textual reading schools: historically\nimportant, yes, culturally transformative, no. My hope is that DH can be something\nmore than text analysis done more quickly.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:45 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Really, that is just an etyrno-\nlogical battle that might only reflect a preference for studying Facebook over Pride\nand Prejudice and which a particular scholar thinks is more socially relevant. What\nwe choose to call these practices seems less significant than actually doing them,\nand if within the academy we end up dividing humanities computing from emerg-\ning media studies, with each getting its own name, I am not sure this would be an\nentirely unproductive division. Instead, though, I want to suggest we think about a\ndifferent way to conceive of this problem, via Walter Benjamin.\n\nThave become convinced over the last few years that Benjamin’s “The Work of\nArt in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” is one of the most important essays in\nmedia studies, not because of Benjamin’s careful reading of the photograph, film,\nmechanization, and art or the effects these things have on culture but rather for the\ndiscursive approach that he uses during his investigation. That is, it is less the precise\ncontours of the argument in relation to art or fascism but rather his methodology\nthat I find crucial. What Benjamin says is that rather than ask, is photography art?\nwe need to ask the more important questions: What does having the photograph\ndo to our concept of art? How does the mere existence of the photograph change\nour ability to conceive of art as such? What change does the existence of the photo-\ngraph bring about from which there is no going back?\n\nBy extension, asking, what is the digital humanities? or, should this particular\napproach to humanities be included under a tent of digital humanism? is to perform\na less than productive inquiry. Rather, we should be asking what the digital does to\nour concept of the humanities and, by extension, even our concept of the human.\n\nIt is clear to me now, and I think it should be clear to any scholar, that the digi-\ntal does not merely transform all means by which we do scholarship—word pro-\ncessors instead of pencils, computers instead of card catalogs, text encoding instead\nof notes scribbled in margins and notecards. The existence of the digital transforms\nthe very meaning of the word “scholarship.” Simply put, the existence of the digital\ntransforms all areas of culture, not just scholarship. Indeed, scholarly transforma-\ntions are just one small piece of the puzzle. We live in a world that is so thoroughly\ndigital it is impossible, at this point, to talk about the nondigital. To treat the digital\nas simply an adjective that can be added onto the humanities is to attempt to con-\ntain it, to discipline the digital, to regulate it to one among a range of approaches\nto scholarship, rather than to recognize that the only way to do scholarship now is\ndigital. Even if one never turns on a computer, answers an e-mail, or sends a text\nmessage, our cultural support structures are digital to the core: the world is digital\nnow, not analog. If what adding “digital” to the humanities does is just take old dis-\nciplines, old ways of talking about texts and other objects of study, and make them\ndigital, leaving the disciplinarity and the silo structure of the university intact, it will\nhave failed or, more precisely, perhaps, simply reduced itself to an adjective.

Yet despite this,\nit is clear that the object of anxiety is becoming more focused as time goes by. There\nmight have been a time when study of “the digital” seemed generally dissonant amid\nmore conventional studies within history, philosophy, and literature. But in more\nrecent times, people writing conventional books and articles about “new media”\nseldom worry that such work won't count. People who publish in online journals\nundoubtedly experience more substantial resistance, but the belief that online arti-\ncles don’t really count seems more and more like the quaint prejudice of age than\na substantive critique. Increasingly, people who publish things online that look like\narticles and are subjected to the usual system of peer review need not fear reprisal\nfrom a hostile review committee.\n\nThere is, however, a large group in digital humanities that experiences this\nanxiety about credit and what counts in a way that is far more serious and con-\nsequential. These are the people—most of whom have advanced degrees in some\narea of humanistic study——who have turned to building, hacking, and coding as\npart of their normal research activity. This is the segment of contemporary digital\nhumanities (DH) that invented the terms “humanities computing” and later “digi-\ntal humanities’——-the ones for whom any other common designation (game stud-\nies, media studies, cyberculture, edutech) doesn’t make as much sense.

They build digital libraries, engage in “deep encoding” of literary texts, create\n3-D models of Roman ruins, generate charts and graphs of linguistic phenomena,\ndevelop instructional applications, and even (in the most problematic case) write\nsoftware to make the general task of scholarship easier for other scholars. For this\ngroup, making their work count is by no means an easy matter. A book with a bib-\nliography is surely scholarship. Is a tool for keeping track of bibliographic data (like\nZotero) scholarship? A literary critical article that is full of graphs, maps, and trees is\nalso scholarship (if perhaps, a little unusual). Is a software framework for generat-\ning quantitative data about literary corpora scholarship? A conference presentation\nabout the way maps mediate a society’s sense of space is unambiguously an act of\nscholarship. Is making a map an unambiguous act of scholarship?\n\nThere have been both passive and active attempts to address these issues by\nproviding guidelines for the evaluation of digital work. In one of the more notable\ninstances of active intervention, the Modern Language Association (MLA) released\nguidelines for such evaluation. As laudable as such efforts have been—and it should\nbe noted that the MLA began this work over ten years ago—the guidelines them-\nselves often beg the question by encouraging faculty members to “ask about eval-\nuation and support” and to “negotiate and document [their] role” (Modern Lan-\nguage Association). For nontenure-line faculty and staff (e.g., those working in DH\nresearch groups and centers), the problem of evaluation is at least theoretically\nsolved by a job description; if it is your job to build things in the context of the\nhumanities, success at that task presumably resolves the question of what counts in\nterms of evaluation and promotion. Grant funding, too, has functioned in recent\nyears as a form of evaluation. Grants in excess of fifty thousand dollars are quite rare\nin the humanities; grants exceeding twice that amount are by no means unusual in\nDH. Review committees (particularly those above the department level) have been\nmore than willing to view cash awards, often with substantial indirect cost require-\nments, as something that most definitely counts.\n\nBut none of this resolves the core anxiety over whether the work counts as schol-\narship and whether those doing such things are still engaged in humanistic inquiry.\nPeople in DH will sometimes point to the high level of technical skill required, to the\nintellectual nature of the pursuit, and to the plain fact that technical projects usually\nentail an enormous amount of work. But even as these arguments are advanced, the\ndetractions seem obvious. Repairing cars requires a high level of technical skill; the\nintellectual nature of chess is beyond dispute; mining coal is backbreaking work.\nNo one confuses these activities with scholarship. The authors of this paper have\neach made strong claims for building, hacking, and coding as important—and,\nindeed, definitional—activities within DH. Yet we are aware that, despite enthu-\nsiasm for our ideas in some quarters, neither of us has made the case for building\nas a form of scholarship and a variety of humanistic inquiry.

Our hope is rather\nto understand our own practices more fully, with an eye toward strengthening the\npractical arguments our institutions commonly demand.\n\nThing Theory: Can DH Things Be Theories?\n\nIn December of 2008, Willard McCarty started a conversation on Humanist by\nasking whether things like the digital artifacts we build are knowledge if they aren't\naccompanied by some measure of discourse: “Can any such artefact ever stand for\nitself wholly without written commentary and explanation?” (McCarty, Humanist).\nStan Ruecker responded that he thought “we do have categories of artifacts that both\nreify knowledge and communicate it” (Ruecker) and quoted Lev Manovich who,\nat the Digital Humanities (DH) 2007 conference, got up and said something to the\neffect of “a prototype is a theory. Stop apologizing for your prototypes.”\n\nManovich’s statement is provocative, in part, because it answers McCarty’s\nquestion by eschewing entirely the notion of an accompanying discourse. Proto-\ntypes are theories, which is to say they already contain or somehow embody that\ntype of discourse That is most valued—namely, the theoretical. Manovich undoubt-\nedly had in mind not the standard scientific meaning of the word “theory’—an\nexplanation for a set of observations that can predict future observations—but\nsomething closer to the way the term is commonly used in the humanities. In the\ncontext of history or literary study, “theory” doesn’t predict, but it does explain. It\npromises deeper understanding of something already given, like historical events\nora literary work. To say that software is a theory is to say that digital works convey\nknowledge the way a theory does, in this more general sense.\n\nAlan Galey and Ruecker went on to claim, in a subsequent article, that “the\ncreation of an experimental digital prototype [should] be understood as convey-\ning an argument about designing interfaces” (405). In this view, certain prototypes\nare understood to do rhetorically what a theoretical discourse does by presenting a\nthesis that is “contestable, defensible, and substantive” (412). They made this argu-\nment with full awareness of the institutional consequences—namely, that “digi-\ntal artifacts themselves—not just their surrogate project reports—should stand as\npeer-reviewable forms of research, worthy of professional credit and contestable as\nforms of argument” (407). It is the prototype that makes the thesis, not discursive\naccompaniments (to borrow McCarty’s formulation) like white papers, reports, and\npeer-reviewed papers. They illustrate their argument with specific examples, includ-\ning text visualizations like Brad Paley’s TextArc, offering them as graphical interpre-\ntations of a text comparable to a critical or interpretative essay.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:23 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\nL7\n\nva\n\f"

            "result": "78 |\n\nSTEPHEN RAMSAY AND GEOFFREY ROCKWELL\n\nGaley and Ruecker’s vision of the explanatory power of the experimental pro-\ntotype recalls the centuries-old practice of demonstration devices “deployed. in\npublic lectures to recruit audiences by using artifice to display a doctrine about\nnature” (Schaeffer, 157). The eighteenth-century orrery was not a scientific instru-\nment designed for discovery but simply a tool for showing how the solar system\nworked—in essence, a rhetorical device that could be used in persuasive perfor-\nmances. Davis Baird makes the case more forcefully in Thing Knowledge where, as\nthe title suggests, he traces the way scientific instruments convey knowledge within\nthe scientific communities that have the training to interpret them. Baird goes fur-\nther, however, and questions the privilege accorded to the discursive, even accusing\nus of ignoring the communicative power of the instrumental: “In the literary the-\nater, lacking any arsenal of techniques to understand and advance instrumentation,\ntextual analysis will have free play, while in the instrumental and technological the-\natre humanists will be relegated to the sidelines, carping at the ethical, social and—\nfollowing the Heideggarian line of criticism—-metaphysical problems of modern\nscience and technology” (xvii). If Baird is right, then “building” may represent an\nopportunity to correct the discursive and linguistic bias of the humanities. Accord-\ning to this view, we should be open to communicating scholarship through artifacts,\nwhether digital or not. It implies that print is, indeed, ill equipped to deal with entire\nclasses of knowledge that are presumably germane to humanistic inquiry.\n\nThe problem with this explanatory approach to digital artifacts is that it doesn’t\napply to the most problematic—and, perhaps, the most ubiquitous—category of\ndigital tools: namely, those tools that digital humanists develop for others to use\nin the ordinary course of their work as scholars. Such tools are celebrated for their\ntransparency or, as Heidegger puts it, for the way they stand—like hammers or\npencils—ready to hand. Such tools, far from being employed on the center stage in\na performative context, are only noticed when they break down or refuse to work\ntransparently. Such tools don’t explain or argue but simply facilitate. Galey and\nRuecker get around this in their discussion by focusing on experimental proto-\ntypes, which are not tools meant to be used. They imagine a tool like TextArc to be\na visualization tool that makes an argument about interface but not an argument\nabout the text it visualizes. They believe that TextArc’s visualizations “are not really\nabout Hamlet or Alice in Wonderland or its other sample texts; they are about Tex-\ntArc’s own algorithmic and aesthetic complexity” (419). While this might be true,\nit almost disqualifies the tool from being transparent or ready to hand. A digital\nartifact that transparently shows you something else might convey knowledge, but\nit does#t intervene as an explanation or argument; it recedes from view before that\nwhich is represented. Where there is argument, the artifact has ceased. to be a tool\nand has become something else. This other thing is undoubtedly worthy and neces-\nsary in many cases, but it resolves the question of whether “building is scholarship”\nby restricting building to the creation of things that, because they are basically dis-\ncursive, already look like scholarship.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:23 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "Developing Things\n\nThe Digital as a Theoretical Lens or Instrument\n\nA second way to think of digital artifacts as theories would be to think of them as\nhermeneutical instruments through which we can interpret other phenomena. Dig-\nital artifacts like tools could then be considered as “telescopes for the mind” that\nshow us something in a new light. We might less fancifully consider digital artifacts\nas “theory frameworks” for interpreting, in the same way that Jonathan Culler views\nFoucault’s theoretical interventions.\n\nAs with prototypes, there is a history to this view. Margaret Masterson in “The\nIntellect’s New Eye,” an essay in the Times Literary Supplement of 1962, argued that\nwe should go beyond using computers just to automate tedious tasks. Using the tele-\nscope as an example of a successful scientific instrument, she argued for a similar\nartistic and literary use of computing to “see differently.” One recalls, in this con-\nnection, Steve Jobs’s early presentation of the Macintosh as a “bicycle for the mind”\nthat would (in an ad campaign some twenty years later) allow us to “Think differ-\nent.” Such analogies, even in their less strident formulations, reinforce the sugges-\ntion that digital artifacts like text analysis and visualization tools are theories in the\nvery highest tradition of what it is to theorize in the humanities, because they show\nus the world differently.\n\nOne of us has even argued that visualization tools work like hermeneutical\ntheories (Rockwell). A concordancing tool, for example, might be said to instanti-\nate certain theories about the unity of a text. The concordance imagines that if you\ngather all the passages in the text that contain a keyword, the new text that results\nfrom this operation will be consistent with the author’s intentions. Whatever other\nwork it might perform, it is informed by this basic theoretical position. While we\nmight regard such a position as crude in comparison to more elaborate theories of\ndiscourse, it is not hard to imagine tools that instantiate subtler theories deliber-\nately and self-consciously (and perhaps more in keeping with present theoretical\npreoccupations). Further, digital instruments work a lot faster. Reading Foucault\nand applying his theoretical framework can take months or years of application. A\nweb-based text analysis tool could apply its theoretical position in seconds. In fact,\ncommercial analytical tools like Topicmarks tell you how much time you saved (as\ncompared to having to read the primary text).*\n\nWe are, of course, uncomfortable thinking of theories in this highly utilitar-\nian manner. Yet there is a tradition of philosophical pragmatism in which theories\nare thought of quite explicitly as tools to be used. As William James famously said,\n“Theories thus become instruments, not answers to enigmas, in which we can rest”\n(98). He wanted philosophical theories not just to explain things but to be useful\nand argued that the way to judge theories was to assess their usefulness or their “cash\nvalue.” This instrumental view is argued historically by John Dewey in works like\nReconstruction in Philosophy:\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:23 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\nL 79\n\f"

They are to be\naccepted as bases of actions which test them, not as finalities. To perceive this\nfact is to abolish rigid dogmas from the world. It is to recognize that concep-\ntions, theories and systems of thought are always open to development through\nuse. ... They are tools. As in the case of all tools, their value resides not in them-\n\nselves but in their capacity to work shown in the consequences of their use. (145)\n\nDewey was not a mean instrumentalist. He believed that it was necessary to recon-\nstruct philosophy (and by extension the humanities) so that it could guide action\nrather than just become the solace of pedants. He wanted theories to be useful\ninstruments for living, not the high mark of scholarship. It is by no means idly spec-\nulative to imagine that he would have recognized that computers, by virtue of their\nability to automate processes, could thus instantiate theories at work. He almost\ncertainly would not have objected to the idea of a theory packaged as an applica-\ntion that you can “run” on a phenomenon as an automatic instrument (provided\nwe remained open to the idea that such theories might cease to be useful as the\ncontext changed).\n\nIf highly theorized and self-reflective visions of tools as theories fail to be suf-\nficiently tool-like, one might say that so-called thing theories of the instrumental\nsort outlined here err in the opposite direction by being insufficiently open about\ntheir theoretical underpinnings. A well-tuned instrument might be used to under-\nstand something, but that doesn’t mean that you, as the user, understand how the\ntool works. Computers, with chains of abstraction extending upward from the bare\nelectrical principles of primitive XOR gates, are always in some sense opaque. Their\ntheoretical assumptions have to be inferred through use or else explained through\nthe very stand-in documentation that we are trying to avoid treating as a necessary\npart of the tool. For Baird, the opacity of instruments ist a problem; it is simply\npart of how scientific instruments evolve in the marketplace. Early instruments\nmight demonstrate their working (as they certainly did in the case of early com-\nputer equipment), but eventually they get boxed up and made available as easy-to-\nuse instruments you can order—effectively installing the user at a level of abstrac-\ntion far above whatever theoretical claims might lie beneath.\n\nBut the understanding of underlying theoretical claims is the sine qua non of\nhumanistic inquiry. For tools to be theories in the way digital humanists want—in\na way that makes them accessible to, for example, peer review——opacity becomes\nan almost insuperable problem. The only way to have any purchase on the theo-\nretical assumptions that underlie a tool would be to use that tool. Yet it is the pur-\npose of the tool (and this is particularly the case with digital tools) to abstract the\nuser away from the mechanisms that would facilitate that process. In a sense, the\ntools most likely to fare well in that process are not tools, per se, but prototypes—\nperhaps especially those that are buggy, unstable, and make few concessions toward\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:23 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

The most minimal definition of a\ncomputer—the one that typically reigns within the rarefied fields of information\ntheory and theory of computation—considers a computer to be any mechanism\nthat transforms information from one state to another. Such terse conceptions aim\nto be widely inclusive but, like tool as prototype, often end up excluding much that\nwe would want to acknowledge in a definition of computing as a sociological activ-\nity (whether for DH or for computer science more generally). More expansive defi-\nnitions that try to allow for a wide range of activities are common. Here is a recent\none from an article that begins with the question, “What is the core of computing?”\n(sbell, 195):\n\nIn our view, computing is fundamentally a modeling activity. Any modeler must\nestablish a correspondence between one domain and another. For the compu-\ntational modeler, one domain is typically a phenomenon in the world or in our\nimagination while the other is typically a computing machine, whether abstract\nor physical. The computing machine or artifact is typically manipulated through\nsome language that provides a combination of symbolic representation of the\nfeatures, objects, and states of interest as well as a visualization of transforma-\ntions and interactions that can be directly compared and aligned with those in\nthe world. The centrality of the machine makes computing models inherently\nexecutable or automatically manipulable and, in part, distinguishes comput-\ning from mathematics. Therefore, the computationalist acts as an intermediary\nbetween models, machines, and languages and prescribes objects, states, and\n\nprocesses. (198)\n\nThe idea of computing in the humanities as a modeling activity has been advanced\nbefore, most notably by Willard McCarty, who notes “the fundamental depen-\ndence of any computing system on an explicit, delimited conception of the world\nor ‘model’ of it” (Humanities Computing, 21). For McCarty, such notions help to\nestablish a critical discourse within DH by connecting humanistic inquiry to the vast\nliterature and philosophy of science, where “modeling has been a standard method\nfor a very long time”\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:23 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[81\n\f"

Lf computers can be enlisted in the task of gain-\ning this understanding, then a failure to welcome methodologies that substantially\nemploy computational methods is surely a reactionary stance. Moreover, since one\nwould expect the results of that methodology to appear as a “visualization of trans-\nformations and interactions,’ the normal output of computational methods is sim-\nlarly unproblematic. We may reject the understanding of the world put forth by\na humanist using computational methods and even point to the output of those\nmethods as evidence of insufficiency or error; but, if digital humanities is about\nusing computers to provide robust interpretations of the world (however contin-\ngent, provisional, and multiple), then it is manifestly not incommensurable with\nhumanistic practice.\n\nThe question, rather, is whether the manipulation of features, objects, and states\nof interest using the language of coding or programming (however abstracted by\ngraphical systems) constitutes theorizing. And here, the nature of the problem of\nbuilding reveals itself most fully as a kind of category error. To ask whether cod-\ning is a scholarly act is like asking whether writing is a scholarly act. Writing is the\ntechnology-——or better, the methodology—that lies between model and result in\nhumanistic discourse. We have for centuries regarded writing as absolutely essential\nto scholarship. We esteem those who write much, penalize those who write little,\nand generally refer to the “literature” when evaluating the state of a discourse. But\nin each case, we speak metaphorically. We do not mean to propose that the act of\nputting words on a page is scholarship. We seek, instead, to capture metonymically\nthe quality of the intervention that has occurred as a result of the writing. Schol-\nars conceive the world and represent it in some altered form. That writing stands\nas the technical method by which this transformation is made is almost beside the\npoint. One recalls, in this context, Marshall McLuhan’s gnomic observation that\nthe “medium is the message”——that the message of any medium or technology is\nthe “change of scale or pace or pattern that it introduces into human affairs” (8).\nYet this analogy falters on a number of points. The act of putting words on a\npage (or finished works considered in isolation from readers) may not be scholar-\nship in some restricted sense, but the separation between writing, conceiving, and\ntransforming is hardly clear-cut. That one might come to understand a novel or an\nissue or a problem through the act of writing about it forms the basic pedagogy of\nthe humanities. We assign students writing not merely to provide us with evidence\nthat they have thought about something but rather to have that thinking occur in\n\n \n\nthe first place.\n\nIn discussing this issue, then, we may borrow the phrase that inaugurated the\nphilosophical discourse of computing. As Alan Turing proposed “What happens\nwhen a machine takes the part of [a human interlocutor] in this game?” as a replace-\nment for “Can machines think?” (434), so may we substitute “What happens when\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:23 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

The compar-\nison strikes us as particularly strong. In reactions to the Turing test, one may easily\ndiscern a fear of machine intelligence underlying many of the counterarguments.\nIt is neither unfair nor reductionist to suggest that fear of an automated scholar-\nship—an automatic writing—informs many objections to the act of building and\ncoding within the humanities.

Accord-\ning to a Modern Language Association (MLA) study of 2007 through 2008 doc-\ntoral recipients in English and foreign languages, the median time from a Bachelor's\ndegree to a PhD is ten to eleven years (2). As such, graduate students entering doc-\ntoral programs in 2011 will likely not be receiving their degrees until the end of the\ndecade. Assuming even the most fortunate of degree paths, they will likely not be\ncoming up for tenure until 2025. Given the volatility of digital culture and the dig-\nital humanities, it is difficult to know how to prepare entering graduate students\nfor that job market or their careers beyond. To what extent do we imagine that all\nhumanities doctoral students should have fluency with digital scholarly and ped-\nagogical methods? Today, the typical literary studies graduate student might be\nexpected to have a baseline fluency in a range of critical, theoretical methods as\nwell as the ability to teach at least one literary survey course. In the future, will there\nbe-—and should there be—some digital component to this shared baseline know1-\nedge? Will all humanities doctoral students need to have fluency with digital schol-\narly and pedagogical methods? And for those graduate students who specialize in\nthe digital humanities, how will that field be defined?

Digital humanities clearly means different things depending on one’s\ndisciplinary perspective, and yet, to some degree, there is also an emerging entity\nthat is digital humanities itself that confronts traditional humanities disciplines and\ndemands attention.\n\nToa large extent, the answers to these questions depend on how one defines the\ndigital humanities, and that definition is currently in flux. The history of the term,\nas explained by Matthew Kirschenbaum, begins in 2002 with John Unsworth in\nthe field previously known as humanities computing (2). Kirschenbaum recounts\nUnsworth’s participation in the decision that led to the title of Blackwell’s Compan-\nion to the Digital Humanities (published in 2004) as well as to the creation of the\nAlliance for the Digital Humanities Organizations in 2005 and finally the National\nEndowment for the Humanities’ (NEH) creation of a Digital Humanities Initiative\nin 2006. Each of these namings essentially equated digital humanities with the prior\nfield of humanities computing. While humanities computing has a long history, dat-\ning back to the earliest days of computers, there are other humanities research prac-\ntices involving the study of computers and related technologies with well-established\npractices. Research in computers and composition dates to the beginning of the\n1980s, with the first issue of the journal Computers and Composition appearing in\n1983. New media studies emerges, along with the “new” media itself, from the field\nof media studies, which itself has been active since at least the middle of the last cen-\ntury. Certainly new media studies as the study of Internet culture develops in the\n1990s along with that technology. In a similar vein, the cultural study of technology\ndates back to the earliest days of cultural studies and Raymond Williams's investi-\ngation of television. As with new media studies, the study of digital culture emerges\nalongside the increasing prevalence of digital technologies. One might also point to\nvideo game studies as a particular specialized field of digital research emerging in\nthe 1990s, though clearly with a longer history in the study of games.\n\nWhen humanities computing was known as such, it existed in relative comfort\nalongside these other modes of investigation. Indeed, on local levels, there were likely\ncommon points of interest between, for example, someone in humanities comput-\ning and someone in computers and. composition regarding department expendi-\ntures on technology or university computing policies. However, there was little cross-\nover between humanities computing and these other fields in terms of scholarship\nor pedagogy. That is, the issues that might arise in scholarly work or in a course on\nhumanities computing are quite different from those that one would typically find\nin any of these other fields. As I view it, there is a significant shift in emphasis that\nseparates humanities computing from these other fields. Humanities computing is\nprimarily focused on the digital and or computational study of the humanities, while\nthese other areas, though each unique in its own right, share a common focus in the\nhumanities’ study of digital technology and culture. That is not to say that scholars\nin humanities computing are vet interested in studying digital technologies from a\nhumanities perspective; nor do 1 mean to suggest that scholars in these other fields\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

It would seem that each of these areas has its own mix\nof technical facility and critical methods. The cultural study of technology is largely\nundertaken using traditional methods of scholarship. In computers and composi-\ntion, my own field, it is not uncommon for specialists to have skills in digital media\nproduction and less commonly programming and to employ these in the study of\ndigital technologies. In humanities computing, technical ability is a necessity; and,\nwhile there is certainly an awareness of a critical engagement with technology, most\nof the scholarship undertaken is directed as traditional humanistic areas of study-—\nfor example, Jerome McGann’s archive project, “The Complete Writings and Pic-\ntures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.” Such a project clearly requires a critical engagement\nwith technology. However, the project is not itself'a scholarly study of digital technol-\nogy; it is research into Rossetti’s works. In reviewing the content, or even the titles, of\njournal articles and conference presentations in the fields of humanities computing,\ncomputers and composition, new media studies, the cultural study of technology,\ngames studies, and so on, there is a clear difference in emphasis between humanities\ncomputing and the others, where humanities computing is primarily interested in\ncomputing as a research method and these other fields primarily focus on comput-\ning as an object of study. This observation is not meant as a critique of any field but\nsimply as a recognition that a scholar who identified with humanities computing\nwould not likely be mistaken for being in one of these others.\n\nScholars in these research areas have coexisted with little conflict, but the cre-\nation of the term “digital humanities,” and the NEH’s subsequent adoption of that\nterm to organize its funding of technology-related humanities research, brought\nthem into a new relationship with one another, creating an umbrella term with\nwhich they must contend. I have seen this in my own professional experience,\nthough there are many scholars who could tell similar stories. I first taught in a\ncomputer lab in 1992 and have been teaching using a variety of technologies since.\nI was the editor of an online literary magazine in 1996. My dissertation, completed\nin 1997, included a study of the role of technology in composition. Since then, my\nscholarship and teaching has operated. in the areas of computers and composi-\ntion, new media studies, and the cultural study of technology. In short, I have been\nengaged in the humanistic study of technology for nearly twenty years, but I have\nnever once thought of myself as being in the field of humanities computing. On the\nother hand, how could I not think of myself as a digital humanist? That said, I do\nnot mean to put too much emphasis on the particular genesis of the term “digital\nhumanities.” Given the global, information revolution over the past two decades,\nit is not surprising that significant changes have taken place in the humanities use\nand study of digital technology.\n\nWhile such differences can be viewed as another rehearsal of familiar territorial\nbattles among academics, there are larger issues at stake.

In November 2010, a group of\ndigital humanities scholars, led by Alan Liu, Geoffrey Rockwell, and Melissa Ter-\nras, formed a group called 4Humanities with a primary mission of using the digi-\ntal humanities to advocate for the humanities. As the 4Humanities mission state-\nment observes, the digital humanities “catch the eye of administrators and funding\nagencies who otherwise dismiss the humanities as yesterday’s news. They connect\nacross disciplines with science and engineering fields. They have the potential to\nuse new technologies to help the humanities communicate with, and adapt to, con-\ntemporary society” (“Mission”). However, one might wonder if this growing inter-\nest from administrators, funding agencies, and others is in humanities computing,\nnow renamed, or in the larger umbrella of digital humanities. In part the answer to\nthis question might be framed in terms of the Horizon Report, an annual document\nproduced collaboratively by EDUCAUSE and the New Media Consortium, which\nidentifies technologies “on the horizon” for adoption in higher education. The 2011\nreport observes, “Digital media literacy continues its rise in importance as a key\nskill in every discipline and profession” and identifies this as the number one criti-\ncal challenge facing higher education in terms of technology Johnson et al., 3). In\na similar vein, HASTAC, the Humanities, Arts, Sciences and Technology Advanced\nCollaboratory, asks in its mission statement, “What would our research, technol-\nogy design, and thinking look like if we took seriously the momentous opportuni-\nties and challenges for learning posed by our digital era? What happens when we\nstop privileging traditional ways of organizing knowledge (by fields, disciplines,\nand. majors or minors) and turn attention instead to alternative modes of creat-\ning, innovating, and critiquing that better address the interconnected, interactive\nglobal nature of knowledge today, both in the classroom and beyond?” Such ques-\ntions, along with the concerns regarding new media literacy, would certainly seem to\nfall within the purview of the humanities and thus would seem to be central ques-\ntions of a digital humanities for the future, and yet these would not be the kinds\nof research questions that have traditionally defined humanities computing. They\nwould, however, be precisely the kinds of questions asked by computers and compo-\nsition, new media studies, the cultural studies of technology, and even games stud-\nies as they enter into concerns of serious or educational gaming.\n\nIn short, we find ourselves at a difficult crossroads in the digital humanities.\nLf we define digital humanities in its narrowest sense as the use of computational\nmeans to study traditional humanistic content, then it is likely fair to say that it can\nand will remain a kind of methodological specialization, akin to being a Marxist or\nfeminist critic. Humanities computing appears poised to grow in numbers of schol-\nars, and it is likely that all humanities graduate students will be expected. to have\nsome knowledge of the field, just as they are expected to know something of Marx\nor feminism today.

Digital technolo-\ngies are raising increasingly pressing questions for humanists and higher education.\nIf we think of the humanities educational mission as one that is founded on liter-\nacy, not just in the sense of a basic reading and writing literacy, but in the sense of a\nbroader cultural literacy, then the growing need to teach digital literacy impacts all\nhumanities faculty. As relatively uncommon as an insistence on humanities com-\nputing in job ads for literary scholars is today (growing but still uncommon), it is\nquite typical for faculty teaching rhetoric and composition to be expected to use\ntechnology for teaching and be able to teach digital or “multimodal” composition.\nWhen one adds searches for humanities computing faculty to searches for digital\nculture, new media studies, game studies, technical/professional writing, and digi-\ntally proficient rhetoric and composition faculty, then one begins to see a faster\nexpanding demand for digital humanities, broadly conceived. And those numbers\n\n \n\nwould just be within English studies. From this view, it is not unreasonable to expect\nthat all incoming humanities graduate students will require a yet undefined digital\nliteracy just as they acquire a shared humanistic (print?) literacy today.\n\nFurthermore, just as digital media are transforming every aspect of the way we\ncommunicate, they will inevitably shift the way humanities scholars conduct their\nresearch. This shift in humanities research practices will not be determined by new\ntechnologies any more than the development of typewriters, industrial printing,\nand other late industrial technologies “determined” the shape of twentieth-century\nhumanities scholarship. However, just as one might recognize that twentieth-\ncentury scholarship relied upon, and emerged in connection with, the communi-\ncation technologies of the period, one might equally recognize that the scholarly\npractices of this century will develop in relation to emerging digital technologies. As\nsuch, today’s graduate students will not only face a professional career where they\nwill need to help students develop a digital literacy; they will also be employing an\nas-yet-undeveloped, specialized. digital literacy of their own as teachers and schol-\nars. As a result, while undefined and perhaps always in flux with the ongoing churn\nof digital innovation, graduate students in the humanities face multiple, related but\nalso dissimilar, challenges. They will require a critical understanding and technical\nfacility with a broadly conceived digital literacy that would be roughly analogous\nto contemporary humanities faculty understanding and facility with print literacy.\nThey will require some level of technical facility with digital production and pro-\ngramming, though the particulars of that will certainly vary among fields and disci-\nplines. Finally, as teachers they will require a technical facility and critical, pedagogi-\ncal understanding of the use of emerging technologies in the classroom.\n\nLegacy Research\n\nWhen we look at our legacy scholarly and teaching practices, it is possible to histori-\ncize them in several ways.

No doubt, the contemporary humanities share rhetorical\nand scholarly practices that extend deep into history. At the same time, disciplines\nhave specific rhetorical and scholarly practices that identify them as disciplinary.\nThat is, for example, a journal article in literary studies has specific discursive fea-\ntures that make it not simply an “essay” or an “argument.” These features, ] would\nargue, are largely the product of the late industrial period. That is, the general shape\nand scope of published research reflects access to information; the speed of com-\nmunication; and the difficulties of composing, editing, and publishing scholarship.\nBefore the second industrial revolution in the United States, scholarly practices\nwere quite different. Indeed the entire project of higher education was revolution-\nized during the late nineteenth century. Specifically, for language and literary study,\nthe first MLA convention, and subsequently the first issue of MLA’s flagship pub-\nlication PMLA, came about in the 1880s. Professional organizations and related\njournals in history and philosophy date from the same period. Not coincidentally,\nas many scholars have noted (sce Berlin, Connors, Graff, Russell, and Scholes, for\nexample), this professionalization of humanities scholarship occurs during a time of\nrapid expansion for higher education. As James Berlin notes, in 1870 in the United\nStates, 5,553 faculty taught at 563 institutions; by 1900, there were 23,868 faculty-\nheld positions at 977 institutions (22~23). This increase mirrored. the demand for\na new educated class of the American workforce during the second industrial revo-\nlution. Undoubtedly industrialization not only provided. technological means for\ntravel, communication, and publication but also ushered in a new era of profession-\nalism and approaches to management that was reflected in both the administration\nof universities and the organization of disciplines.\n\nIndustrialization not only prodded the growth of higher education; it directly\nsupported the development of scholarly practices in the humanities. While the ear-\nliest MLA conventions were likely facilitated by rail travel, contemporary national\nconferences were built on air travel, a national highway system, and the general\nprocess of urbanization that led to conference centers and such: MLA is just one\nof many national conferences in many industries. Similarly PMLA becomes one of\nmany periodicals in an age of industrial printing, and scholarly monographs fit into\na larger publishing industry. An investigation of the various assemblages’ or net-\nworks that have participated in the formation of humanities discourses could extend\ninterminably. However, I think it is fair to say that the typical length of a journal\narticle (around seven thousand words) or conference presentation (twenty min-\nutes) is not a reflection of some tangible, epistemological structure in humanities\nresearch: under different technological constraints, these would likely be different.\nThe economic limits that constrain the number of articles in a journal or how often\na journal publishes no longer apply to digital publication. The traditional rationale\nfor national conferences as the best if not only way for scholars to meet and com-\nmiutnicate no longer applies.

These assemblages play a central\nrole in the establishment of pedagogical and scholarly practices and consequently on\nthe professional, ethical relations we have established with one another. For instance,\nunlike a laboratory, which requires a team of people to operate, the default mode\nfor humanities academic labor has been for a professor to work independently. Of\ncourse, independence is a relative term. All scholars draw upon other scholars in a\nvariety of ways. However, typically, humanities scholars work alone while searching\ndatabases, archives, and library shelves; reading monographs, essays, and articles;\nand composing their scholarship. It is unusual for humanities scholarship to appear\nwith more than two authors, let alone the long lists of authors that will accompany\nwork in the sciences, for example. While late industrial technologies did not deter-\nmine these practices, they became part of the assemblage of scholarly production.\nAnd just as it would be difficult for a single person to produce scientific scholarship\nwithout collaborators, it is challenging to collaborate in the humanities. Given that\nthe assemblage operates effectively with a single author, one essentially has to invent\nnew roles for additional participants. While there are certainly examples of notable,\nlong-standing collaborations in the humanities, they are the exceptions to the rule.\n\nAs the humanities shift into a digital assemblage, however, these practices are\nchanging, and this is already apparent in digital humanities fields, where research\nindicates a growing amount of collaboration (Meyer et al.). As with the sciences,\ndigital humanities projects can require a broad range of expertise and a significant\namount of labor, more than one person could expect to undertake. As Alan Liu\nnotes, “It requires a full team of researchers with diverse skills in programming,\ndatabase design, visualization, text analysis and encoding, statistics, discourse analy-\nsis, website design, ethics (including complex ‘human subjects’ research rules), and\nso on, to pursue ambitious digital projects at a grant-competitive level premised\non making a difference in today’s world” (27). In other words, there is a growing\nbody of digital humanities work that requires collaboration. More broadly, how-\never, the development of networked communication has facilitated collaboration\nfor humanities scholars undertaking more traditional scholarship as well. I could\npublish this chapter on my blog as soon as it is finished and alert my colleagues via\nTwitter, Facebook, e-mail listservs, and so on. I would likely receive more, and more\nimmediate, feedback from my colleagues that way then I will ever receive from pub-\nlishing this chapter in a printed book. In fact, I wouldn’t even need to wait until I\nwas finished. I could publish this part today and the rest later. However, I could go\nbeyond a publish, feedback, and conversation model to engage in more substan-\ntive collaboration of a scholarly work. That is, while the traditional scholarly model\nasks authors to respond to the requests and feedback of reviewers and editors, the\nauthor remains the sole person to make meaningful changes to the text (aside from\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

This practice is extended to the web when, for example, one\nauthors a blog and invites comments. Though blog comments are public, where edi-\ntorial and reviewer comments often are not, the blogger retains sole control of the\ntexts he or she posts. However, social media obviously also allows for both real-time\nand asynchronous collaboration, resulting in a composition with multiple authors.\n\nIn short, from a technological perspective, it would. be fairly easy to collabo-\nrate with a number of scholarly colleagues. From every other perspective, though, it\ncould be quite difficult. Put simply, while we have all been carefully and extensively\ntrained to research and write articles and monographs, we have little or no prepa-\nration for working as a networked community. In our defense, for most contem-\nporary academics, such networks did not exist when they were in graduate school.\nOur scholarly discourses and practices were built in a century when information was\nrelatively scarce and communication was comparatively difficult. Today, the condi-\ntions are so different that it is only the weight of institutional inertia that keeps us\ngrinding forward, even as academic publishers fail, journal subscriptions dwindle,\nand. humanities funding disappears. Though humanists are skilled at recognizing\nthe historical contexts of the objects they study, they have largely overlooked the\nhistorically contingent nature of their own scholarly practices. As unlikely as a near\nfuture (Le., the next fifteen to twenty years) without journal articles might be, it is\nequally unlikely that scholarly practices will move forward without being signifi-\ncantly transformed by emerging technologies. Currently, we have little understand-\ning about what practices will develop in the next decade, even though we face the\ntask of preparing graduate students for that decade today.\n\nIn this context, one encounters a third digital humanities. It is not simply the\ndigital/computational study of the humanities or the humanistic study of the digi-\ntal; it is the way in which the humanities as a whole shifts from a print paradigm\nto a digital one. It is in this sense that all the humanities becomes subsumed within\nthe digital, and it is at this level that the concern for a digital education in graduate\nprograms affects everyone in the humanities.\n\nTeaching and Digital Literacy\n\nBecause humanities graduate students tend to come directly from humanities\nundergraduate majors and most of those majors provide little education regarding\ndigital technologies, the typical student enters his or her graduate education as a\nnovice in regards to the digital. Certainly there are exceptions to this rule. Students\nwho developed an undergraduate interest in the digital could certainly have found\nan education in it. However, an education in the digital humanities or more gener-\nally in digital technology is hardly a common feature of an undergraduate career\nin the humanities, though in humanistic fields that verge into the social sciences\nor the arts, such as communications, fine arts, or media study, one is at least more\nlikely to find departments where traditional humanities courses intermingle with\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 357\n\f"

This has required a substantial push in professional develop-\nment to prepare TAs for this new digital task. Where two years ago only a handful of\nour sixty-five TAs would have had experience in teaching online, by the end of the\n2011 summer, nearly half of our TAs will have done so.

As\nsuch, teaching online requires the development of a new digitally mediated literacy\nthrough which the instructor can communicate with students and foster discussion\nand interaction in the class. In addition, our composition program has instituted a\n\n \n\nrequirement whereby every composition course includes at least one formal “digital\ncomposition” assignment. While the requirement remains vague, the graduate TAs\nand. adjunct instructors have developed a variety of assignments that require stu-\ndents to produce slidecasts, web pages, or video. The TAs have needed to develop a\nfacility with some consumer-level digital production tools, ranging from slideware\nand image editors to audio and video editing, as well as knowledge of various social\nmedia platforms they might employ (blogs, wikis, etc.). Again, while the technical\nlearning curves of such tools are not especially steep, there remain more challenging\ngoals, such as developing a rhetorical skill with the technology (Lc., i's one thing to\nmake a slideshow, but making an interesting one is a different challenge) and then\nfiguring out how to teach these lessons to their students. Thus, even though most\nof our doctoral students are pursuing dissertation projects that are not in the digi-\ntal humanities, the other demands of the department have begun to require them\n\n \n\nto develop a digital literacy.\n\nThe interesting result is that the graduate students encounter humanistic, rhe-\ntorical, and ethical questions regarding digital technologies as teachers first rather\nthan as students or scholars. They wonder how to create and sustain online dis-\ncussion forums or motivate their students to write longer blog posts. They strug-\ngle with creating and evaluating digital composition assignments. They ask ques-\ntions about copyright and make decisions about public and closed online spaces\nand. open source versus proprietary applications. Unfortunately they do so with\nonly the cursory support of a few professional development workshops and with\nlittle or no experience doing digital work in their own coursework. While genera-\ntions of novice teachers have largely had. to discover for themselves their own teach-\ning styles, at least they could draw on their experiences with faculty as a model for\ntheir own pedagogies. While all faculty discover that some essay assignments work\nbetter than others, at least they all knew what an essay was.

Of course, it may still be possible for humani-\nties graduate students to avoid using digital technologies in their teaching and not\naddress the challenges of helping their students communicate in digital media. It is\ncertainly possible for graduate students to write dissertations with a minimal use\nof digital technologies (e.g., word processors, library databases). However, it is now\ncertainly a choice they must make.\n\nSimilarly, graduate faculty must also make a choice or, more accurately, a wager.\nLf we believe that the demands and expectations for teaching and using digital tech-\nnology in the next decade will not increase appreciably, then we are likely free to\ncontinue organizing our departments and curricula as we currently do, We can con-\ntinue to hire according to existing models of what our departments should look like,\nmodels that have not changed. much in the last twenty or thirty years. If, however,\nwe find reason in the arguments put forth by groups like HASTAC, 4Humanities,\nor EDUCAUSE, then we have reason to believe that there will be a growing expec-\ntation that humanists will be able to address the educational and intellectual chal-\nlenges of our digital culture. And if we believe that, then we face the difficult tasks\nof hiring faculty, reworking curriculum, and perhaps even developing profession-\nally ourselves to meet those challenges.\n\nAside from hiring, which is almost always a contentious matter, the greatest\ndifficulty for both graduate students and faculty will be discovering ways to infuse\ndigital media into their teaching and scholarship. While developing a real facility\nwith programming and design may remain a specialization, learning to use main-\nstream social media and digital production tools on a basic how-to level is not hard.\nThough we tend to speak of steep learning curves for faculty facing technology, the\nwidespread participation in social media from YouTube to Wikipedia should be evi-\ndence in itself that learning the basics is not the challenge. Put differently, it’s easy to\nset up a blog, and one can learn how to post in a few minutes. Maintaining a blog\nover an extended period of time is an entirely different matter. One not only faces\nrhetorical and compositional challenges in determining appropriate subject mat-\nter and developing a regular blogging practice but also must address the changing\ntechnological contexts in which the blog operates. Contemporary bloggers employ\na variety of media, intersect with Twitter, Facebook, and other social media, and\ndrive their content to a variety of devices in a way that bloggers five years ago would\nnot have. In a similar vein, one could learn the basics for using a half-dozen of the\nmost popular digital tools in a few days, but keeping up with the continual churn\nof new devices, applications, and practices would demand ongoing attention. The\nshort duration of the specific kinds of expertise one might receive in technologi-\ncal training (e.g., learning how to use a particular application) is a phenomenon\nthat is unusual in the humanities. Humanities faculty and students expect their\neducation to have some real durability. That is, if one reads a novel in a course,\none expects that the reading of that novel and much of the scholarly conversation\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

In\ncontrast, lessons in Dreamweaver are durable for maybe one or two versions. Per-\nhaps the surrounding discussion of principles of web design and HTML lasts a lit-\ntle longer, but as it turns out, they, too, are quickly supplanted by a different, social\nmedia version of the web.\n\nHowever, durability is only part of the problem. The real difficulty lies in cre-\nating opportunities for the technologies to be put to work. Developing facility with\ndigital media must be tied fairly closely to pedagogical or research objectives. Oth-\nerwise, any training one receives will lie fallow and potentially become outmoded\nbefore one returns to it. In teaching, this is a little easier than it is with scholarship.\nAt the University at Buffalo, the need to offer online courses and the institution of\na digital composition requirement for our first-year writing courses created both a\nneed for graduate students to develop some digital literacy and an opportunity for\nthem to put that literacy to work in their teaching. Of course such practices are not\nwithout their resistances. If one viewed. an existing course, like a first-year compo-\nsition course, as complete already, then adding digital components would under-\nstandably be viewed as extra work. Instead, successfully infusing digital media into\nany curriculum requires rethinking the entire work of a course, not its goals nec-\nessarily but its work, That is, for example, a literary survey course would have the\nsame fundamental goals as always in introducing students to the primary features\nof literature from a given historical moment, and clearly the primary activity of\nthat course would remain the students reading those works. However, the conver-\nsations among the students and faculty, the major assignments students undertake,\nthe research they do, the larger communities with whom they might interact, and\nultimately, as a result, the activities within the classroom might all be transformed.\nWhy undertake such changes? Hopefully not to meet some top-down bureaucratic\npressure or to pursue some trend but rather because such infusion might be the best\nand most likely way for the humanities to investigate how their traditional objects\nand. methods of study shift from the print cultures in which they were born into\nthe emerging digital culture where they must learn to thrive. Certainly this is the\napproach we have taken with our composition program, where traditional activities\nlike journal writing, in-class workshop groups, and class discussion are now mixed\nwith blogging, web-based peer review, and online forums. In terms of graduate\neducation, the hope is that following several semesters of infusing digital technol-\nogy because it is required programmatically that TAs will gain enough expertise and\nconfidence to explore the use of technology in other, noncomposition courses. It is\nimportant to note again, though, that composition is a somewhat unique example\nin the humanities. Like general education courses in the arts, which might ask stu-\ndents to engage in digital photography or graphic design, composition courses have\nalways focused on production. On the other hand, those humanities disciplines that\nhave always focused on interpretation, like literary studies, have aligned themselves\nquite differently in relation to technology. In those fields, the tradition has not been\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Perhaps for this reason, the broad introduction of digital work across\nthese fields has come more quickly and seamlessly (though certainly not without\nchallenges) than in other areas of the humanities.\n\nDigital Spaces and the Ethics of Scholarship\n\nUnfortunately, making an analogous transition toward digital scholarly practices in\nother humanities disciplines is more difficult. While some graduate students may\nrelish the opportunity to break new ground, and really all dissertation writers have\nin their mind at least some pressure to make an “original” contribution, it is unfair\nto ask graduate students to bear the burden of inventing new digital scholarly prac-\ntices. For graduate students who would specialize in digital humanities, computers\nand writing, new media studies, and another existing areas, there are already estab-\nlished paradigms to work from. That is, one knows not only generally what a com-\nputers and writing dissertation looks like but also the kind of work that one does to\nproduce one. The questions for graduate students and assistant professors in these\nfields instead tend to whether or not other humanists and departments will recog-\nnize and value their research. My interest in this chapter, however, has been with\nthe larger question of how the humanities as a whole will rise to the general shift of\ndigital media. In my view, this shift is analogous to the late nineteenth-century shift\nthat brought us the journal article and later the monograph, as well as the national\nprofessional conference. This shift is also analogous to the one we face with our\nteaching. However, in the case of teaching, we face expectations to teach students\ndigital literacy as a primary goal of humanities curriculum, in addition to using\ndigital media as a means to achieve other goals. In scholarship, while we might face\n\n \n\nexternal economic pressures to publish digitally, for the most part we are answer-\nable only to ourselves in determining how we will use digital media as researchers.\n\nConversations about the impact of digital technologies on humanities research\npractices have focused on two areas: the creation and use of digital tools for analyz-\ning humanities texts and publishing born-digital scholarship. I would not be sur-\nprised if there came a time in this century when digital research tools and born-\ndigital scholarly composition were as common as close reading and essay writing\nare today, but that time may not come for several decades. In the shorter term, it is\nthe larger ecology of social media that is relevant. Just as digital pedagogy explores\nthe use of social media to expand conversations beyond the classroom and con-\nnect students with larger communities, humanities scholars need. to explore the\npossibility of establishing networked communities and employing social media to\nconnect with a larger audience. As with teaching, learning the basic how-tos is rel-\natively simple; the challenge is adapting one’s scholarly practices to incorporate\nsocial media. Certainly some humanists, particularly digital humanists, have been\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

When one thinks of this “larger audience,’ one might think of the general\npublic, and to some extent that is the case. However, most academics may continue\nto write for more specialized, professional audiences than a general public and for\nthem, social media will also enable access to a larger audience in their own fields\nand across the humanities.\n\nHowever, incorporating a social media practice into humanities scholarship is\nnot easy. There are several obstacles. One can find celebrations, critiques, attacks,\nand. defenses of the academic use of social media across the Internet. Its not my\nintention to rehearse those arguments here. Instead, as I suggested. earlier, as aca-\ndemics we simply have a wager to make. Either we believe that the humanities can\nsurvive as an essentially print-based intellectual practice or we believe the humani-\nties will need to adapt to contemporary communication and. information tech-\nnologies. If one believes the former, then I suppose one has little concern for the\nissues I have raised here. If, however, one believes the latter, then the question is not\nwhether academics, and graduate students in particular, need to adapt to digital\nmedia, but how.\n\nThe challenges, in the end, are ethical, and by this 1 mean that the challenges\nstem from the values we place on particular activities and the specific relations we\nestablish among ourselves. While digital media will not, in any straightforward,\ndeterministic way, alter the underlying goals of humanities research (e.g., literary\nscholars will continue to study literature for largely the same reasons as they do\ntoday), they will alter our everyday practices. That is, quite simply, the technologies\nand applications we will use to conduct research, communicate with one another,\ncollaborate (potentially) on projects, compose our scholarship, review and edit our\nwork, and publish our findings will change. Alongside these technological changes,\nwe will need to rethink how we value emerging scholarly practices, new forms of\nprofessional service, and the professional development they will require. In terms\nof graduate school, then, the objective must be to introduce students to new prac-\ntices and encourage the students’ development of these practices. In suggesting this,\nI do not mean putting graduate students in situations where they must argue that\nblogging, for example, should “count” as a scholarly activity along the continuum\nof other scholarly publishing. If such arguments are to be made, the task should not\nfall upon our most vulnerable members. Instead, the value of a digital social media\npractice should be reflected in the better articles, essay collections, and monographs\nthat scholars produce through its practice. In time, such publishing genres will prob-\nably transform, but that transformation, while likely to be informed by the larger\necology of digital practices, should not be confused for that ecology.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\nwe\n\nme\n\f"

These presences represent a kind of remediation of the\ntraditional and ongoing organization of curriculum and scholarship. A course blog\nor wiki typically has a one-semester duration; and, even if it persists from one itera-\ntion of a course to the next, its primary audience remains those in the course. Indi-\nvidual faculty and students in social media likely have audiences that stretch beyond\ndepartments; but generally those presences, to the extent that they are scholarly,\nremain vertical within one’s specialization and are not likely to gain the attention\nof one’s department colleagues. Projects such as the CUNY Academic Commons;\nthe Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC);\nand. MediaCommons each serve as a platform for academic collaboration across\ninstitutions and across disciplines. Graduate students and faculty might participate\nin these communities as a way of reaching beyond local departments. However\nthis still leaves open the question of how a department-level community will work.\nWhere projects on both the small, individual scale (like a blog) and on a large scale\n(like HASTAC) operate on the basis of shared academic interests, departments are\nimagined as microcosms of the disparate interests of a discipline or, as in the case\n\n \n\nof many English departments, multiple disciplines. Department structures such as\nbylaws, committees, and curriculum serve to manage those disparate interests if not\ncombine them in some felicitous way for students. As I have been discussing, the\ndigital humanities can and does enter humanities departments as a specialization,\nas one of many interests (i.e., one can hire a digital humanities specialist). However,\ndigital media and technologies also impact the humanities across specializations,\naltering the relations among faculty and students. To give a single example: fifteen\nyears ago it would have been largely impractical on a technological basis for the con-\nversations and work undertaken in one graduate course to be taken up in relation\nto the conversations and work undertaken in another course being offered in the\nsame term. Today, from a technological perspective, it would be easy for a depart-\nment community to conduct academic conversations in a public forum. Perhaps it\nwould be risky. Perhaps it would not be pedagogically effective, though in making\nthat claim we would have to be certain we still knew what the aims of graduate edu-\ncation ought to be. However, these are ultimately ethical concerns, concerns regard-\ning what we should do. They are not concerns regarding what we can do.\n\nWhat might a department-level public forum of this type be like? Undoubtedly,\nthe first fear would be that the kinds of departmental political in-fighting seen on\nfaculty listservs and in department meetings would be made public in some embar-\nrassing way. Exposure, as always, is a prime inhibitor for faculty in social media. To\nwhat extent would a department administrator find it necessary to moderate online\nconversation? Would faculty and students ultimately be able to differentiate between\nan intellectually productive discussion of differences and some all-out war of words?\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

One thing is certain: a civil discourse about scholarly and\nintellectual issues across specializations and philosophical-political positions in the\nhumanities would need to be invented. If the digital humanities could usher in such\na discourse, then it would truly be a boon.\n\nSome intermediary gestures would include a nonpublic, department-level con-\ntent management system (e.g., Drupal). Clearly not all conversations need to be fully\npublic anyway. This would allow graduate students to develop some facility with a\nsocial media presence and to explore some of the potential collaborations networks\nmake possible while mitigating some of the fears of exposure. Another possibility\nwould be a public space that was focused on a particular area of specialization, for\nexample, rhetoric and composition. A blog of this kind would not be limited to a\nparticular course but would be composed by students and faculty across a program\nin this area and addressed publicly to others in the field. There are many examples of\nsuccessful academic group blogs in various fields that might be employed as models.\nAcommunity site of this kind would provide a way for graduate students to develop\na professional-digital identity, collaborate with their departmental colleagues, and\nestablish connections with others in the field. Ideally, such sites, if initiated at mul-\ntiple institutions, would ultimately aggregate into a larger conversation that gradu-\nate students could take with them as the moved into other academic positions. This\narrangement would be of mutual benefit and would draw links between local com-\nmunity conversations and the larger initiatives we see with HASTAC, MediaCom-\nmons, and CUNY’s Academic Commons. One of the big challenges recent gradu-\nates face when moving into new academic positions, often at smaller schools, is the\nloss of their academic community. Sites of this type would mitigate that feeling.

It is not about learning to use specific technologies or\nprogramming languages. Or rather, it is about all these things and a hundred oth-\ners yet to come. Fundamentally the challenge lies in recognizing our humanities\ndisciplines as they have been shaped by twentieth-century technologies and real-\nizing that they must be shaped anew. In doing so, we need to examine the ways\nin which our ethics have developed in the context of past technological networks\nso that we may engage directly in establishing new ethical practices that meet the\nchallenges and take advantage of the opportunities that digital media present us.\nGraduate education is one of many sites where this work must be done as we meet\nour commitment to prepare those entering our field to work in a digital future that\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:30 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 365\n\f"

The concept of assemblage is developed in the work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix\nGuattari and then later in Manuel DeLanda. As DeLanda explains, assemblage theory “was\nmeant to apply to a wide variety of wholes constructed from heterogeneous parts. Entities\nranging from atoms and molecules to biological organisms, species and ecosystems may\n\nbe usefully treated as assemblages and therefore as entities that are products of histori-\n\n \n\ncal processes.

Assemblage theory provides a method for investi-\ngating the “heterogeneous parts” involved in the development of disciplinary paradigms.\nIn the case of humanities, scholarly assemblages cannot be solely cultural or discursive\nbut intersect a variety of objects, including, most notably, the communications technolo-\n\ngies of the early twentieth century.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n“About HASTAC.” HASTAC: Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Col-\nlaboratory. hitp://hastac.org/about.\n\nBerlin, James.

Ted’s son, the\nenterprising young Jamie, makes Vicky speedread research for his history report and\nwrite the report for him. His grades improve dramatically as Vicky reads an entire\nhistory textbook and produces an exemplary report that earns Jamie an invitation\nto his school’s honor club. He fools both his teacher and parents but, plagued by a\nguilty conscience, eventually admits that Vicky completed his homework. When\nJamie's teacher asks who wrote the report, Vicky confesses. In disbelief, the teacher\nquestions her on the contents of the report. Impressed, the teacher says, “I wish we\nhad a bright little girl like Vicky at our school”! Indeed, Vicky manages to pass for\nhuman in both oral and written expression.\n\nWhile the stuff of bizarre television shows and emerging technology in the\n1980s, the phenomenon of computers performing tasks thought to require sentience\nand human cognition has become commonplace.

This raises several important questions: Who is the presumed\nsubject of digital humanities scholarship? And how is digital humanities reinstanti-\nating a normative human subject in the digital cultural record?

Anyone with accounts on these platforms could speak\nwith Tay, which was designed to “engage and entertain people where they con-\nnect with each other online through casual and playful conversation? Microsoft\nfurther intended for the bot to gather information about and emulate the conversa-\ntion patterns of eighteen- to twenty-four-year-olds in the United States, promising,\n“The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more\npersonalized for you.\"s What the company did not expect, however, was how quickly\nTay would learn the vocabulary and speech patterns of the internet's racist trolls\nand progressively learn how to create social media messages more appropriate for\na neo-Nazi than a millennial. In addition to denying the existence of the Holocaust,\nthe chatbot compared Barack Obama to a nonhuman primate, stumped for Don-\nald Trump, and advocated for genocide, all in the course of a few hours. Microsoft\nsummarily took the chatbot offline, issuing a statement to address its controversial\ncontent: “The AI chatbot Tay is a machine learning project, designed for human\nengagement. As it learns, some of its responses are inappropriate and indicative of\nthe types of interactions some people are having with it. We're making some adjust-\nments to Tay.” Artists Zach Blas and Jemima Wyman's video installation “im here to\nlearn so :))))))” gives Tay an afterlife, where she dances, lip syncs, and offers insight\non pattern recognition algorithms, neural networks, Silicon Valley, and cybersecu-\nrity.’ The case of Tay illustrates the range of issues at stake in the development of\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2026 18:31:49 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\f"

They seem to promise that humanity is edging ever closer to the tech-\nnological singularity, when artificial intelligence will be able to redesign itself and\nautonomously create more powerful machines, generating computational superin-\ntelligence beyond human prediction and cognition. Such a point is perhaps closer\nthan ever. University of Cambridge researchers, for example, have developed a robot\ncapable of reproducing itself, programming it to assemble smaller robots, and in\ndoing so, recursively self-improve.* This development has prompted observations\nthat robots and other forms of artificial intelligence are getting closer to mastering\nprocesses thought to be unique to humans.\n\nAs such developments occur, they are often greeted by excitement over tech-\nnological progress and innovation; after all, they hold great promise for accelerat-\ning the speed at which data analysis can occur. However, they also engender fear\nover their ethical and social implications as they valorize normative human subjects\nthrough their design. They raise questions of what it means to look, speak, write, and\nthink as “a human?’ Invariably, the answer to this hews to dominant cultural values\nof the Global North, reinforcing the cultural, historical, and technological othering\nof communities in the Global South. In a field as diverse in method, thought, and\nsubject as digital humanities, it is essential to examine the ethical challenges these\ntechnologies pose and their effects on methodologies. Moreover, attending to such\nissues emphasizes the unique value of the humanities for science and technology,\nwhich is evident in digital humanities practices that use humanistic lenses to ana-\nlyze digital objects, cultures, and technologies.\n\nIn the broader context of these technologies, an area that remains under-\nexplored is the way that the “human” is articulated, produced, and normed in the\ndrive toward emulating “human” processes.

For René\nDescartes, being and cognition are yoked in the phrase cogito ergo sum (“I think,\ntherefore I am”); conversely, Descartes posits that animals do not have language or\nspeech and therefore lack consciousness.'” Yet, this human Enlightenment subject is\na narrowly conceived category from which women and colonized or enslaved peo-\nples are excluded; therefore, the human/animal binary is already troubled by those\nwhose identities position them outside the category of “human? Later, Immanuel\nKant raises the issue of rationality, arguing that the difference between human and\nanimal is reason.!! A number of thinkers have complicated these constructions.\nCharles Darwin, for example, argues that traits like sense, emotion, and intuition\nare not limited to humans but are visible in animals.’ Jacques Derrida makes a\nsimilar claim on the basis that humans themselves may not possess the attributes\nof humanity that have been articulated in the European philosophical tradition.?\nNotably, the subject ofhuman thought throughout this body of work is exclusionary,\n\n \n\nbased on the primacy of the white, male, European Enlightenment subject. it thus\nfails to encompass the full sweep of humanity, including women, working classes,\nand people within the Global South, including those who have been enslaved and\ncolonized. The fraught nature of the human subject articulated in this body of work\nis the very “human” that shapes the development of the humanities.\n\nDevelopments in computing technology have influenced investigations about\nthe nature of humanity as well. While humans and computers appear radically dif-\n\n \n\nferent in form, computing is increasingly focused on replicating human processes.\nAn early inkling of this movement was evident in IBM’s computer Deep Blue, the\nchess-playing machine that beat Grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1996. Now, IBM's\nWatson, an artificial intelligence supercomputer, has successfully defeated Jeopardy!\nchampions, including Ken Jennings, who holds a record number of consecutive\nwins on the game show, and Brad Rutter, the show’s highest earner of award money.\nWatson has seen a number of applications, such as making health care decisions\nfor lung cancer at Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, powering self-driving buses, and\nserving as a teaching assistant at Georgia State University, where students did not\nrealize that Jill Watson was, in fact, a chatbot.’4 Given the humanity ascribed to such\ntechnologies, it is incumbent on digital humanities practitioners to engage with the\nquestion of what kinds of subjectivities are centered in the technologies that facili-\ntate their scholarship.\n\nAn important model for interrogating these matters in digital humanities\nappears in feminist and postcolonial science and technology studies scholarship,\nwhich brings together the philosophical and technical implications of human\nsubjectivity by raising concern over divisions between the binary categories of\n“human” and “nonhuman.” Donna Haraway, for example, has emphasized the need\nto deconstruct the division between the two through her work on the cyborg.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2026 18:31:49 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\f"

For example, Jane Bennett posits the existence of a\nvibrant materiality that connects human and nonhuman bodies.!” Appreciating the\nrelationship between the human and nonhuman is essential to understanding the\ncontemporary world. As Karen Barad’s theory of agential realism posits, the world is\nbest interpreted through connections between human and nonhuman, rather than\nthe presumption that they occupy separate realms.'* When computers and other\nforms of technology blur the boundaries between human and machine, as they are\npresently doing, the nature of humanity comes into question. When engaging with\n“artificial intelligence,’ scientific scholarship positions “artificial” as nonhuman but\nseeks to replicate processes of “human cognition?’ The term “artificial? which dates\nto the early fifteenth century, denotes “made by man” and is further related to “arti-\nfice? connoting “skill, cunning? “device,” and “trick”?° The goal of artificial intelli-\ngence is to create devices that skillfully trick humans into believing that computers\nare capable of cognition—and it is increasingly becoming more successful.\n\nBut what forms of “human” are sanctioned when artificial intelligence can\nreproduce human processes? Alison Adams argues that artificial intelligence reflects\n“Western” presumptions about human intelligence, privileging white, Eurocentric\nmale subjectivity as the form of cognition on which it is modeled.”! This effects the\nerasure of women from the history of scientific knowledge production. These dis-\nembodied neural networks” and other cognitive models are being created based on\ntheories of human cognition that are themselves the result of observing intellectual\nprocesses of white men of the Global North. Therefore, artificial intelligence pur-\nports to represent universal “human” intellectual processes but, in fact, is only repre-\nsentative of a fictive “universal” model of human cognition that elides women, peo-\nples of the Global South, and those at the interstices of these categories. In addition\nto reflecting such biases, these technologies are based on tech stacks, platforms, and\ncode that privilege knowledge production of the Global North in their design. Com-\nplicating the relationship between human and nonhuman in these cases is essential\nto understanding the connections between the two and the influences of norma-\ntive human subjectivities on technological development. As technologies like algo-\nrithms and artificial intelligence are brought into digital humanities practices, it is\ncritical to understand the assumptions subtending their development.\n\nThere are a wide array of instances where universal notions of humanity are\ninvoked and implied in computing. Syed Mustafa Ali’s work provides an example of\nhow to uncover them and interrogate their politics. He raises the issue of robotics\nin this regard, making the case that humanoid robots produce and obscure racial\nconcerns in purpose and form.

Through the coupling of camera\nand algorithm, Sophia is capable of visual recognition. Built with Google Chrome\nvoice recognition, Sophia processes speech and uses the input for machine learning.\nAccording to company founder David Hanson, “Artificial intelligence will evolve to\nthe point where they [robots) will truly be our friends. Not in the ways that dehu-\nmanize us, but in ways that rehumanize us, that decrease the trend of distance\nbetween people and instead connect us with people as well as robots.” He credits\nthe humanoid face installed on Sophia with facilitating connections with humans,\nmaking the case that a robot needs a “beautiful and expressive” face to do so.”* Mod-\neled after Hanson's wife and Audrey Hepburn, Sophia raises not only the issue of the\nunacknowledged influence of race in the production of robots that Ali identifies\nbut also the question of aesthetics governing “beauty.” The significant market for\nskin-whitening products and plastic surgery in Asian countries is one example of\nthe way that whiteness has come to signal the global standard for beauty, a legacy\nof white supremacy and colonialism. Another important example is the Clark doll\nstudies, first run in 1939 and repeated in 2009, in which children of multiple races\nrepeatedly identified a white doll as more beautiful than a black one.” By speaking\nto the visual dimensions of the face, Ali provides a physical example of what is, in\nmost cases, an ephemeral understanding of the way that technologies are coded\nby race. Ali’s analysis itself is an important contribution to digital humanities and\nits capacity for using humanistic inquiry to think critically about and complicate\nprogressive narratives of technological development.\n\nIn the same way, a reading of “Large-Scale Image Memorability,’ or LaMem,\ndeveloped by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, illustrates the implications\nof these issues for digital humanities because LaMem draws on a database of images\nand machine learning algorithms in its methods. LaMem is artificial intelligence\nsoftware reported to have “near-human” accuracy for memory, applying predic-\ntive algorithms designed to identify images that are most “memorable” LaMem is\navailable online and users can upload images that are then scored for memorability,\nwith heat map overlays indicating the most memorable portions of the image. While\nLaMem is not, strictly speaking, a digital humanities project, it raises troubling ques-\ntions of how a universal human is interpolated in method.\n\nLaMem relies on the concept of “intrinsic memorability” of facial images.\nIntrinsic memorability has been studied by the lab of one of LaMem’s designers,\nWilma Bainbridge, through creation of a 10,000+ image database representing the\nadult U.S. population, “following gender, age, and race distributions’”* Amazon\nMechanical Turk workers with IP addresses in the United States coded the images\nfor demographic matching. They were then tasked with identifying “intrinsically\nmemorable” dimensions of these images.

It is undercut by scholarship that claims memorability is influ-\nenced by racial and ethnic affiliation.” Moreover, these results are represented as\ngeneralizable to human populations, though they depict only a specific subset of\nusers in the United States. While such an intellectual move is typical within dis-\ncourses of the sciences, both feminist and postcolonial scholarship within science\nand technology studies have raised ethical questions about doing so.*! By claim-\ning that this research signifies human processes, Bainbridge and colleagues locate\nsubjects in the United States at the center of a universal form of the human. While\nother scholars have made allowances for the subjective nature of memorability, they\nalso aim to find evidence of agreement that supersedes subjective ditference.*? This\nis an important example of how the seeming objectivity of technology, an assump-\ntion that runs through many digital humanities projects and methods, can lead to\nthe instantiation of a normative human subject. Further, it makes the case for prob-\nlematizing this presumption.\n\nLaMem also gestures toward problems with reproducibility and data coding\nthat influence digital humanities practices. When creating LaMem, project direc-\ntors selected images that had been used in these earlier memorability experiments,\nwhich were assigned memory scores and fed to the project’s algorithms. They offered\nno indication of why the images were memorable, but the results were comparable\nto memorability scores rated by data coders.*® By using images from previous stud-\nies, they replicate the centrality of data from the United States while making gener-\nalizable claims about human processes. Reproducibility is often invoked as a marker\nof validity, but it is valid only in relation to initial design. When the design itself\ncontains fundamental presumptions about human subjectivity, simply producing\nmore results only confirms the initial biases incorporated in it. One place this hap-\npens in LaMem is in the coding of data, which is portrayed as an objective process.\nLaMem used Amazon Mechanical Turk to code data, but its creators fail to iden-\ntify who was included in or excluded from that labor pool, unlike Bainbridge and\ncolleagues, who only selected workers with an IP address in the United States. As\nthe majority of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers reside in the Global South, the\nquestion of who arbitrates memorability in LaMem is cloudy, and the anonym-\nity of the Amazon Mechanical Turk labor pool raises questions about the cultural\nlocations from which memorability is being determined. This is troubling not only\nfrom the perspectives of labor ethics—the pool of workers is paid mere pennies for\nperforming coding tasks—but also from the reliability of results from data coded\nby an undefinable source.\n\nThese issues are particularly important as digital humanities practitioners turn\nto sources like Amazon Mechanical Turk for their projects. Notably, Lev Manovich’s\nselfiecity relied on Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to code selfies for age and\ngender, while Ryan Heuser’s Mapping Emotions in Victorian London used them\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2026 18:31:49 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\n3\n\f"

Instead, the creators make claims\nabout their data that appear to transcend difference without establishing a basis for\nmaking meaning of the data. The presumption of a universal subjectivity endangers\nthe integrity of the data, which is unaccountably influenced by the particulars of the\nworkers’ identities, cultural backgrounds, and geographical locations. As a result,\nthis work exemplifies a troubling approach that foregrounds utility and instrumen-\ntal rationality in project applications and serves as an important warning for digital\nhumanities practitioners.\n\nThe Algorithmic Universals\n\nMethodological choices embracing artificial intelligence and neural networks are\nfurther implicated in the construction of a universal human subject. This is evident\nin LaMem, which is situated by default in the epistemological and ontological moor-\nings of the Global North, deploys an unspecified labor source drawn largely from\nthe Global South, and simultaneously claims to reproduce “human” memorability.\nFailing to identify its own standpoint, the project elides cognitive processes that\nmay be shaped by the particulars of lived and embodied experience.** Moreover,\nthe creators developed LaMem using artificial neural networks, which are designed\non information processing procedures and tasks engaged by the brain. Neural net-\nworks have been embraced by the artificial intelligence community because they can\nbe automated to process large datasets and identify patterns without human inter-\nvention. Like other methods subtending artificial intelligence that are based on\nmodeling human cognition, these networks make universal claims about human\nprocesses based on scholarship that privileges a white male subject. As Carl Stah-\nmer’s work suggests, the application of artificial intelligence to digital humanities\nis largely focused on the interoperability of technical processes, particularly for\ninterventions that engage with big data.** This acultural approach fails to attend to\nthe cultural politics that subtend the production, circulation, and consumption of\nhumanities data itself. Another troubling concern surrounding the use of neural\nnetworks is the challenge of identifying the precise processes at work. For example,\nthe creators of LaMem—like many others who engage with artificial neural net-\nworks and algorithms—cannot explain the mechanisms by which their software\nworks.” While they can explain the algorithms designed and why they used them,\nthe exact processes by which LaMem arrives at results about memorability are a\nmystery to the creators. Regardless, they express confidence in the response, claim-\ning accurate results.

They shape how we understand the world and\nthey do work in and make the world through their execution as software, with pro-\nfound consequences?** Among the myths that the era of big data has produced is that\nthe scope and quantity of data being produced by people is so vast in scale and com-\nputing is so powerful that their outputs are becoming increasingly more objective.\n\nHowever, considering the variety of ways in which algorithms are deployed to\nassist with conclusions that might otherwise be drawn by people alone—banking\nand loan decisions, likely recidivism for criminals, or employee hiring—the\nstakes of algorithms are high. The lack of transparency and the seeming black box\nnature of algorithms obscure the fact that they are subject to biases, in spite of\nmyths that suggest their objectivity.*° When they are deployed for subjective deci-\nsion making, there are no guarantees of accuracy, and they function as gatekeepers\nof information. An example of this is YouTube's algorithmic labeling of LGBTQ+\ncontent as unsuitable for users under age eighteen, which included videos that did\nnot contain violence, nudity, or profanity. Algorithms do so with biases that are\nnot obvious but reflect the values of engineers who create them and the purposes\nfor which they were created.\n\nThese issues are critical for digital humanities practitioners to consider.

Such moves are evident in projects\nlike heureCLEA, a “digital heuristic” for identifying “narratologically salient fea-\ntures in textual narratives?“ This language and the project itself suggest that narra-\ntive features of a text are divorced from its content, including its circumstances of\nproduction and cultural location. The algorithms the project uses are tasked with\ndecisions about narratological salience that are themselves subtended by univer-\nsalist notions of the human rather than situated in the contexts informing the text.\nLike other algorithms, they are steeped in the cultural and political implications of\ncomputation and code. These implications are overdetermined by the ontological\ncategories and epistemological processes of the Global North. Further, datasets and\ndatabases used in conjunction with algorithms are themselves constructed and sub-\nject to political and social forces.\n\nThe Humanoid Text\n\nIn the realm of computational textuality, which is a popular subject in digital\nhumanities scholarship, algorithms are also complicit in instantiating universal, and\ntherefore exclusionary, forms of the human. One area in which this is particularly\nimportant is the use of natural language processing software and machine learning\nto produce texts that can “pass” as human. As Christer Clerwell argues, readers are\nincreasingly unable to tell the two types of compositions apart.” The phenomenon\nof “passing” in racial politics in the United States connotes the practice of people of\ncolor who can be accepted as a member of a different race because of their pheno-\ntypical features presenting themselves as a member of that other group (typically as\nwhite). The term has come to be used to signify the broader ability of members of\na particular identity category to convince others that they occupy a different one.\nThe “humanoid texts” composed by computers are engaged in a similar act of dis-\nsimulation: presenting themselves as being written by humans when they are, in\nfact, computer generated.\n\nIndeed, humanoid texts are increasingly becoming more successful at passing\nfor human. When teaching digital literature courses, J include a unit on computer-\ngenerated texts, which begins with an exercise where I show students texts generated\nby computers and texts composed by humans, asking students to determine which\nwere created by computers and which were written by humans. These texts range\nfrom news stories to snippets of code to poems, all of which confound students\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2026 18:31:49 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\f"

This is particularly ironic because Harlem\nRenaissance writers like Toomer were writing to lay claim to the humanity of Afri-\ncan Americans and their place in the democratic space of the nation through their\ncapacity to produce art. Yet, Toomer’s poem cannot pass for human.\n\nThis phenomenon is a direct result of one of the goals for natural language\nprocessing software: to develop algorithms and programs that can replicate “human”\nlanguage. A nonhuman actor, in this case, is tasked with completing a “human” task.\nJust as “artificial” intelligence is expected to mimic human cognition but instead\nreplicates white, Eurocentric male cognition, natural language processing software\nis complicit in the production of normative forms of the human. At stake in the pro-\nduction of humanoid texts is the question of universalism. With the move to gen-\nerate software and algorithms that replicate “human” processes, particular forms\nof “human” are authorized. As postcolonial scholars have argued, the Enlighten-\nment gave rise to the idea of a homogeneous definition of “human, which centers\nthe European subject and, in turn, marginalizes all whose cultures, lifestyles, and\nvalues deviate from the universal. Postcolonial theory, crucially, has made the case\nfor the importance of the particular, grounded in the idea that, indeed, cultures—\nspecifically the cultures of colonized or formerly colonized communities—are left\nout by universalist discourse.\n\nLanguage and textuality, which are core dimensions of the humanities, have\nplayed a significant role in the valuing of universalism, with the colonizer stand-\ning in as the figure of the universal, devaluing the particular as the culture of the\ncolonized. Textual production of Europe—whether Homer, Shakespeare, or Cer-\nvantes—is valued for its universality and its articulation of a “human condition”\nThat very articulation of “human” produces an essentialist definition expansive\nenough to account for Europe and European cultural production but that does not\nextend to Europe's “Others.” Indeed, the universal is not the universal but the Euro-\npean. Therefore, the universalist move to the “human” legitimates a narrow portion\nof the world as human—dominant cultural powers in particular—while raising the\nquestion of the claim to “humanity” available to a larger swath of the world that has\nbeen or is under the sway of colonialism. Universalist discourses surrounding lan-\nguage and textuality echo G. W. FE Hegel’s assertion that there are people outside the\ndynamic movement of history. While this claim about Africans is well known, Hegel\nmade similar assertions for Indians and nomadic peoples. In the case of Indians,\nHegel accords the absence of history to an absence of written history: “Tt is because\nthe Hindus have no History in the form of annals (historia) that they have no His-\ntory in the form of transactions (res gestae); that is, no growth expanding into a\nveritable political condition?™ Therefore, writing is linked to a particular form of\nhuman consciousness and subjectivity, to the production of culture and the pos-\nsibilities of cultural transformation. In turn, writing—or lack thereof—is linked to\nthe production of the human and to human destiny. Yet, digital humanities proj-\nects that take up computational approaches to textuality often fail to address the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2026 18:31:49 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\f"

For example, Shlomo Argamon and\nMark Olsen's text-mining work aims to distinguish between black and nonblack\nplaywrights and claims that their algorithms can discern between the two. Yet, they\nfail to attend to design of the algorithm itself, what “black” means in the context\nof their work, and its implications of the study. This is especially disconcerting\nbecause what it means for a writer to be “black” is a vexing question, and Argamon\nand Olsen fail to interrogate the ways blackness is coded through language in their\ndata. This isa missed opportunity to contribute to our understanding of the linguis-\ntic features of writing by situating the work in the historical and cultural contexts\nof African diasporic writing.\n\nThe production of a universalist notion of the “human” relies on default-\ning to the aesthetics of dominant cultures and languages. Language wielded in this\ncontext determines the limits of universalism, both those included within its ambit\nand those outside it. Aesthetics that diverge from dominant ones are, accordingly,\noutside the boundaries of the “human” inscribed in writing. Such an idea is evident\nin Thomas Babington Macaulay's infamous “Minute on Indian Education,’ which\nargues for the cultural supremacy of English literature. Macaulay argues that the\nwhole of the literature of the East cannot compare to one shelf of British literature\nand proposes that instruction in English literature might produce a group that is\nIndian in blood but British in taste and intellect.’ For Macaulay and other British\ncolonizers, literature serves as a strategy of domination under the guise of a uni-\nversal culture.** Given that people writing from the margins, whether Anglophone\ncolonial and postcolonial writers or African American writers of the Harlem Renais-\nsance, have used writing to lay claim to voices denied to them, the deployment of\nuniversalist forms of the human through computer-generated text risks deautho-\nrizing these voices.\n\nAsserting the ability of a text, an algorithm, a piece of software, or a computer\nto “pass” as human presumes a universal definition of “human” and reduces the\ntotality of humanity to the ability of a computer to perform a task in a particular\nway defined by a set of limits that reproduces dominant cultural norms. Yet, in the\nresearch on these mechanisms, there is a marked lack of clarity of how “human” is\ndefined. In some cases, this scholarship rests on the notion of “human cognition”\nor the idea that there are certain mechanisms of thought that are, in fact, universal.\nThe ontological and epistemological biases of this scholarship imply that even the\nnotion of human cognition is grounded in the Global North. Universalism in the\ncontext of human cognition and humanoid texts brings with it the presumption\nthat “science” mitigates cultural biases and is immune to difference. However, it\nonly manages to reinforce the politics, cultures, and aesthetics of dominant cultural\nparadigms. Therefore, it is imperative that digital humanities practitioners resist the\nreinscription of a universal human subject in their scholarship, whether at the level\nof project design, method, data curation, or algorithm composition.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2026 18:31:49 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n\f"

W. Robinson\nUniversity of Saskatchewan, Canada\n\n \n\nAbstract\n\nThere appears an obvious fit between the application of ‘social media’ technol-\nogies to the making of scholarly editions in digital form and the markedly col-\nlaborative nature of the typical digital humanities project. Accordingly, it may be\nargued that the model of the collaborative project-based edition need only to be\nextended, to become ‘social’. This article questions that thesis, demonstrating the\nproblems that can arise with collaborative projects applying digital methodolo-\ngies to scholarly work through analysis of the Shakespeare Quartos and the\nEuropean Virtual Museum Transnational Network projects and arguing that\nthe term ‘collaboration’ needs critical examination. Indeed, to the extent that\n‘collaboration’ may be closed, and may serve narrow scholarly purposes, it can be\nthe antithesis of ‘social’. In place of project-based collaboration, this essay pro-\nposes that we see ‘social’ editions as grounded in communities, not in collabor-\nation, and that the principle upon which they should be built is (following\nShirky) “design for generosity’. This implies a different role for the editors and\nscholars from the academy: rather than the leaders of collaborations, we may\nbecome key participants in, and enablers of, communities. In turn, this mandates\na loss of control: generosity means allowing others to use what is given freely,\nincluding in ways not foreseen, and even opposed, by those who created the data.\nFor academics who are used to identifying control with assurance of quality, this\nis a difficult step. Wide adoption of the Creative Commons Attribution licence\n(without the ‘non-commercial’ restriction) would take us far towards these aims.\n\nIn a paper reflecting on his experiences in working\non the Johns Hopkins Roman de la Rose digital li-\nbrary, Stephen Nichols compares the collaboration\nrequired for that project with the collaboration\nrequired for the making of a medieval manuscript.\nNichols describes how, within a single stationer’s\nshop, the production of a manuscript required a\n‘master scribe’, usually the head or owner of the\nshop, who designed the manuscript, procured the\nmaterials for its creation, and then chose, organized,\nand supervised the team of artists and scribes who\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016\nPress on behalf of EADH.

Robinson\n\nNichols goes on to observe that the object so\ncreated is distinct and unique:\n\n“And as with a medieval manuscript, a digital\nversion is its own unique object.’ (p. 15)\n\nAccordingly, Nichols highlights three aspects of the\nRoman digital project for which he finds analogies in\nthe world of medieval manuscript creation, as follows:\n\n(1) Each manuscript, each digital enterprise, is a\nseparate venture: a ‘project’.\n\n(2) Each manuscript, each project, is created by a\nteam of people with different skills, working\ncollaboratively.\n\n(3) Each manuscript, each project, is a distinct\nobject, with its own particular qualities.\n\nWhat Nichols observes of the Roman project, and its\nsimilarities to the production of certain medieval\nmanuscripts, holds for a great many scholarly re-\nsources, created in digital form over the last decades.\nMany of these—all those created through centres such\nas Kings College London, the Institute for Advanced\nTechnology in the Humanities at Virginia, the\nMaryland Institute for Technology in the\nHumanities, and many others; almost all those\nwhich use complex encoding and metadata systems\nsuch as those created by the Text Encoding\nInitiative—~are indeed the result of discrete ‘projects’!\nIn the scholarly world around the turn of the millen-\nnium, as in the manuscript world in the late medieval\nworld, there are good reasons for the dominance of\nthe ‘project’. A ‘project’ constitutes a single manage-\nable unit, for which separate resources may be found,\nwhich can be completed in a predictable time, which\nissues in a distinct material and separable object (a\n\n \n\nmanuscript, a Web site) of which one can say: here is\nwhat I have made. Funding agencies, tenure commit-\ntees, and university administrators all like projects.\nFurther, a project provides an efficient space for a\nteam of people to work together, with defined goals\nand adequate resources: it is a site for collaboration, in\nboth the medieval and digital worlds. Finally, what is\nmade by these projects can be difficult to categorize.\nBooks of Hours, the best-known instance of such pro-\nject-based team creation from the medieval period,\nare so replete with image and ornamentation that\ntheir original function as collections of prayers for\n\n876 — Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016\n\nprivate devotion has receded into the distance, as\nthey become festaments to the grandeur of the\ncourt which commissioned the book: tokens in a\nGame of Thrones, as it were. This is even truer of\ndigital projects, whose output over the last decades\nhas been so varied as to overtax our ability to\ninvent new names. Are these ‘editions’ (which might\nbe ‘born digital’, ‘dynamic’, ‘hypertext’, ‘facsimile’, or\nmany more); or are they ‘archives’, ‘thematic research\ncollections’, indeed ‘arsenals’? (Price, 2009)\n\nThis dominance of the project-based collabora-\ntively created digital resource has been so complete\nthat the question implied in the title of this article\nmight be put as follows: is the current configuration\nof the digital humanities, with its emphasis on the\ncollaborative project, adequate for the making of\neditions which are all three of social, digital, and\nscholarly? For this argument, we may accept the\ninitial premise: that editions which are social, digi-\ntal, and scholarly are desirable, and we should seek\ntheir making. We have a very well-established model\nof collaborative work, already ‘social’ at least to\nsome degree, in the digital humanities, and much\nexcellent work has already been done by many sep-\narate projects. Surely, we need only to extend this\nmodel somewhat further, so that ‘collaborative’ be-\ncomes ‘social’, drawing scholars closer together to\ndigital humanists within the project, and we can\nhave the social, digital, and scholarly editions of\nwhich we dream. Indeed, a recent treatise by\nJohanna Drucker and others, Digital Humanities,\ndeclares confidently that the collaborative project\nis the ‘basic unit? of digital humanities work\n(Lunenfeld et al., 2013, pp. 124-5). Further, the col-\nlaborative nature of the project, ‘rooted in design,\ncollaboration, and performance, often stretching\nacross media and involving multiple agents, produ-\ncers, and authors’, is contrasted with ‘criticism, her-\nmeneutics, and close reading, almost exclusively\nundertaken by a single author who works to articu-\nlate a highly defined problem in a specific discipline’\n(p. 76). The implication is clear: the way forward is\ntogether, working in groups within projects. To the\nprescriptions of ‘the project’ and ‘collaboration’ the\nauthors add a third desideratum: ‘design’:\n\n‘For digital humanists, design is a creative\npractice harnessing cultural, social, economic,\n\nL8/r/ Lereoiuepysp/uico dno owepeoe/y:sdyu uo pepeojumog]\n\nS,\n\nZOZ sequeced gO UO Jasn Aueigr] Ausieaiur euUalA Aq ggzeogzs\n\n8\n\f"

We\nhave, it seems, a clear path forward. Let us establish\na series of collaborative projects, bringing together\ndigital humanists and scholars and designers; let\nthem expand the collaborations to draw in every\nstudent, every reader, and everyone interested; let\ndesign inform every stage of the project, so that it\nis both beautiful and efficient. How could this not\nbe the right way forward?\n\nPractice, the authors of Digital Humanities\nstress at every point, is all (for example, the section\n‘Prototyping and Versioning: Generative\nHumanities Ahead’, pp. 23-5). So let us examine a\nsingle digital humanities collaborative project, ad-\ndressing a major scholarly resource, to see what\nmight happen when these principles are put into\npractice. In 2008, the Maryland Institute for\nTechnology in the Humanities, in partnership with\nthe Folger Library, Oxford University, and other in-\nstitutions, won funding ‘to create the Shakespeare\nQuartos Archive, a freely-accessible, high-resolution\ndigital collection of the seventy-five quarto editions\nof William Shakespeare’s plays’. The first part of this\nwas to create an ‘interactive interface and toolset’\nfor the study of thirty-two copies of one play,\nHamlet. Here is a project that had everything in\nits favour. It had significant funding, from a major\ninternational group: no less than the transatlantic\ncombination of the US National Endowment for\nthe Humanities and the UK Joint Information\nSystems Committee. It had the full backing and par-\nticipation of six of the world’s great libraries, be-\ntween them holding more copies of Shakespeare\nquartos than the rest of the world combined. It\nhad access to the technical firepower of two of the\nleading centres in the world for digital humanities,\nat Oxford and Maryland. Several Shakespeare scho-\nlars are listed in the project’s acknowledgements:\namong them Gabriel Egan (2010a), author of a\nmajor study of the editing of Shakespeare’s text,\nand John Jowett, one of the editorial team of the\nOxford Shakespeare. Further, the focus of the\n\nProject-based digital humanities\n\nproject, on the quarto copies of Hamlet, one of\nthe most studied of all literary texts, placed it right\nin the centre of the humanities.\n\nSix years on, the project has done its work, and\nan elegant and detailed opening web page at http://\nwww.quartos.org/ promises much. Within this page\nis an invitation: ‘Enter the Shakespeare Quartos\nArchive’. Clicking on this yields first a box ‘loading\ninterface’ and then, after a few moments, a warning\n(if you are not using a Firefox browser):\n\n‘This prototype interface for the Shakespeare\nQuartos Archive is best viewed in Firefox ver-\nsion 3.5 or above.’\n\nThe suggestion that this prototype might require a\nparticular configuration of browser and computer is\nnot encouraging. One clicks past this, into a list of\nthe thirty-two quarto editions offered, and finally\nreaches a screen offering access to a Quarto copy,\nin this case the British Library ‘copy 1 of the 1611\nquarto (Fig. 1).\n\nSo far, excellent. But a little more digging un-\ncovers problems. A key aim of the project was that\nit should not just offer images of all pages of all\nquartos: it would capture the text of each page in\n‘TEl-encoded diplomatic transcripts’, and this text\ncould then be used for multiple purposes: collation,\nannotation, searching, and statistical analysis. One\nwould expect then, for each page, to see the cap-\ntured text as well as the page image. Using the\nChrome Browser in a Macintosh with the\nMavericks system, 1 can view the page image, as\nshown above. If I click on the ‘Txt’ icon beside\n“View? in the menu at the top of the screen, how-\never, nothing happens: the text does not appear. On\nthe other hand, if I move to the Firefox browser\n(following the warning given as the interface\nloads) I can see the text, but I cannot see the\nimage. Indeed, if 1 want to view both text and\nimage I need to resort to my ancient pre-Intel\nPowerPC Macintosh PowerBook G4, stuck forever\non system 10.4.11 and Firefox 3.6.18: not a strategy\nfor everyone. There are other problems with this\ninterface. There is a cleverly conceived tool which\nallows you to overlay the image of one page in one\ncopy on the image of the same page in another copy.\nBy adjusting the opacity, one might see at a glance\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016 877\n\nL8/r/ Lereoiuepysp/uico dno owepeoe/y:sdyu uo pepeojumog]\n\nS,\n\nZOZ sequeced gO UO Jasn Aueigr] Ausieaiur euUalA Aq ggzeogzs\n\n8\n\f"

Egan focuses on ten\nvariants from the N (outer) forme of this quarto,\ncorresponding to the end of Act V scene 1 and the\nbeginning of scene 2, distributed across three of the\nfour pages printed from this forme, that is, the recto\npage carrying the signature ‘N’ (beginning ‘Make\nOssa. like a wart’, V.1; conventionally numbered\nNI) and the opening for pages N2°/N3\" (beginning\n“excellent differences, of very soft society’), with the\nfinal page printed from the outer forme, the con-\njunct of NI’ and conventionally N4*, showing no\nvariants in Egan’s analysis (2010b). From close\nstudy of these variants, Egan deduces that this\nforme was corrected twice, giving three states of\nthe text.?\n\nOne might suppose that the ‘Compare’ feature in\nthis archive might permit, in a few moments, the\nidentification of all stop-press variants between the\ncopies, and so allow work which might take months\nor years to be done in a few moments. It happens\nthat three Q2 copies are included in the Quartos\narchive: those from the Folger, Huntington, and\n\nritish Libraries copies, representing (according to\nEgan) the first and second states of the text: Folger\nand Huntington the first, the British Library the\nsecond, with eight of Egan’s ten variants introduced\nin this second state (hereafter, copies F H and BL).\nt is encouraging to discover that seven of these\neight variants (Nir thirtie>thereby, pall > fall;\nN2v dosie > dazzie, yaw > raw, in too’t > doo’t; N3r\nbe hangers > be might hangers, and A did sir > A did\nso sir) are reported in the collation view. It is sur-\nrising to find that while the phrase ‘neither in’ is\ncorrectly transcribed in F and H, and the variant\n‘neither, in’ correctly transcribed in BL, the com-\narison does not report this as a variant. One pre-\nsumes that the comparison has been configured to\nignore punctuation variants. But Shakespeare scho-\nars are very interested in punctuation (Alden, 1924;\nMaxwell 1953, Atkins 2003). Nevertheless,\nrompted by the successful identification of seven\nof eight variants, one might use the comparison tool\n\n \n\nto explore further. Egan refers to variants in three of\nthe four pages printed from this forme. Are there\nany other variants on these pages, missed by Egan\nand other scholars, but found by the comparison\n\nProject-based digital humanities\n\ntool? What of the pages printed from the inner\nforme corresponding to this outer forme, on the\nreverse of these pages, that is the openings NI‘/\nN’r and N3‘/N4\" (beginning ‘My feares forgetting\nmanners’ and ‘The King and Queene and all are\ncomming downe’)? The comparison tool suggests\nthat these two copies, indeed, differ in many other\nplaces on these pages, as follows:\n\nOuter forme, N2°: BL has ‘Dot. Stroke.’ five\ntimes, ‘Double dot. Stroke.’ once, ‘Scribble’\nonce; none of these in H. BL also has an\nextra ‘done’ at the end of the page.\n\n, N3\": BL has ‘N3’ at the end of the page,\nH has ‘N’\n\nInner forme, N1°: H ‘ye ans’, BL ‘yemans’\n——, N3*: BL has ‘Dot. Stroke’ once, not in\nH; BL ‘cushions,’ H ‘cushion,’; BL ‘madnesse’\nH ‘madnes e’; BL ‘my’ H ‘m y’\n\n——, N4\": BL has ‘Onixe’, H “Unice’\n\n \n\nIf indeed these were all differences between the two\ncopies, we would more than double the number of\nvariants found on these two formes, with nine more\nvariants on the outer forme, and six on the inner\nforme. However, on examination of the images of\nthese pages in the two copies, all but one of these\ndifferences disappears. The mysterious ‘Dot.\nStroke.’, ‘Double dot. Stroke.’, and ‘Scribble’ are in\nfact indications of hand-written marks written by an\nearly reader in the BL, and not part of the print\ncopies at all, thus removing eight of these fifteen\nsupposed variants. In four of the remaining seven,\nthe comparison suggests a letter has dropped out of\nthe type, or a space has appeared between two let-\nters, thus the variants on ‘yemans’, ‘cushions’,\n“‘madnesse’, and ‘my’. While not indicating stop-\npress variants, these variants (if real) would be valu-\nable indicators of the order in which the pages came\nfrom the press. Their testimony appears to indicate\nthat the BL page was printed first; thus, ‘yemans’,\n‘cushions’, ‘madnesse’, where H has ‘ye ans’, ‘cush-\nion’, ‘madnes e’, ‘m y’, suggest that letters dropped\nout or moved in the forme between the printing of\nthe BL and H pages.’ If correct, this would directly\ncounter Egan’s hypothesis that the BL page repre-\nsents the second state of the text.

These appear\nto be simple transcription errors, of a kind which\n(we will see) is all too frequent in this archive.\n\nThis leaves three differences between the two\ncopies. Two of them are at the base of the page in\nthe opening N2°/N3\": the presence of ‘done’ as a\ncatchword in BL and not H at the base of N2\",\nand BL ‘N3’ in place of ‘N’ in H at the base of\nN23’. Examination of both copies shows that the\nsupposed differences arise because the base of both\npages in the H copy has been cropped—though\nindeed the top of ‘done’ and the ‘3’ in ‘N3’ are\nboth clearly visible. This leaves just one variant:\n‘Onixe’ BL for ‘Unice’ in H, in the line of the\nKing’s speech commonly rendered ‘And in the cup\nan Union will he throw’. This is a real and well-\nknown variant, but to have to filter out fourteen\nof fifteen supposed differences, to end with one\nthat is real (and already well-known), is inefficient.\n\nA survey of the comparison of copies for other\npages suggests that this ratio, of fourteen false differ-\nences to one real difference, is rather worse in other\nparts of the archive.” In this survey, the comparison\ntool suggested that there were some thirty differences\namong some thirty pages of text, compared across\nten copies. Not one of these was a stop-press variant.\nAbout half were recordings of handwritten texts or\nmarks in one or other copy. The other half were\nsimple transcription errors: several cases where the\n‘long s’ form has been transcribed (incorrectly) as\n‘f in one copy, ‘s’ in the other; several where a\nletter is wrongly reported as absent; and several\nwhere a piece of rogue computer code has infiltrated\nthe text, e.g. ‘I&#x0027; embrace’ National Library of\nScotland for ‘I embrace’ in Folger 1. The reader who\nhas checked all these supposed variants against the\nimages—a rather lengthy task, involving shuffling\nback and forth among various computer win-\ndows—only to discover that none of them is a genu-\nine variant between the printed copies, and has also\nnoticed the frequent incorrect transcription of ‘long\nsas ‘f, an error an undergraduate would blush to\nmake, is not likely to continue to use this tool and\nthese transcriptions.\n\nHow has this happened? There is a disorienting\ninconsistency about the transcriptions. On one level,\nthey display extreme and meticulous care in their\n\nencoding: throughout, every speech by every char-\nacter, and every reference to a character, is asso-\nciated with a three-letter code (‘ham’ for Hamlet,\n‘hor’ for Horatio), which makes it possible, in\ntheory, for one to retrieve every speech by a particu-\nlar character regardless of how he or she is labelled\nin the text itself. One can imagine, in theory again,\nmany possible uses enabled by this encoding. But is\nanyone actually going to use this facility?—and\nindeed, the archive provides no tool leveraging\nthis. By what editorial choice was it deemed more\nimportant to provide this encoding than to correct\nthe transcriptions? Or, to include handwritten add-\nitions to the text in the results of the comparison\nview, but not punctuation variants? This points out\nthe fundamental problem with the archive: deci-\nsions like this, or their absence where there should\nhave been decisions, betray a lack of editorial over-\nsight. After the project was funded and before it\nbegan, the project leaders convened a 1-day meeting\nin Oxford, on 6 June 2008, with twenty participants\nincluding several professional Shakespeare scholars,\nEgan and Jowett among them. There is a full and\nfascinating record of the day’s discussions on the\narchive site, at http://www.quartos.org/info/files/\nSQAAdvisoryForum.pdf. Yet, it appears that after\nthe project started, the digital team was left to\nmake its own choices, with the results that we see.\nThe lack of editorial and scholarly involvement can\nbe seen elsewhere. In the whole site, there is just one\nparagraph of what might be termed scholarly dis-\ncourse: the “History of the Quartos’ offered at http://\nwww.quartos.org/info/about.himl. While the site\nitself offers images and texts of thirty-two quarto\ncopies of Hamlet, nowhere does it say that there\nare many other copies beside these thirty-two else-\nwhere, or provide (as would be very useful) a full list\nof all known copies. The site offers, as we have seen,\naccess to three copies of Q2 (1604-05). But there are\nfour other known copies extant, at Yale, Cambridge,\nWroclaw, and the Bodleian library. It would be\nhelpful for readers to know this. The absence of\nthe Bodleian copy from this collection, in which\nthe Bodleian was a partner, and which does include\nother Bodleian quartos, might be explained by this\ncopy being on loan to the Bodleian, and not owned\nby the Bodleian.

Further,\nDigital_Humanities prescribes that we should ‘em-\nbrace productive failure’ (p. 5). Accordingly, one\nmight learn from this failure and then apply the\nlessons to other collaborative projects, leaving\nintact the collaborative project model.\n\nAt the least, the Quartos project suggests that\ncollaboration is not of itself a recipe for success. A\nproject may instance superb collaboration, but the\nproduct of the collaboration may be rather less than\nthe collaboration itself. The European Union has\nmade projects whose point is the collaboration\nitself something of an art form. Consider, for ex-\nample, the European Framework 7 Network of\nExcellence ‘Virtual Museum Transnational\nNetwork’ (V-MUST). V-MUST ran for 4 years,\nfrom 2011 to 2015, with eighteen partners drawn\nfrom all over Europe, at a total cost (according to\nthe EU CORDIS page at http://cordis.europa.eu/\nproject/rcn/101496_en.html) of over 5 million\neuros, some 4.5 million as a direct contribution by\nthe EU. According to the CORDIS page, the part-\nners ‘aim at resolving the problem of research frag-\nmentation in this field and at sharing the knowledge\nrequired to integrate Virtual Museums into the\nbroader museum domain in a sustainable way.\nThis will be achieved by connecting different\n\nProject-based digital humanities\n\ntechnological domains, by integrating social and\ncognitive sciences, by providing state-of-the-art\ndigital preservation and authoring tools’. Among\nother things, they promise to develop a\n‘Transmedia Project? which will contain several\n“Virtual Museums’. It is not easy, from the main\nV-MUST site, to discover this ‘“Transmedia\nProject’ and its ‘Virtual Museums’. The ‘Virtual\nMuseums’ page does list a series of ‘Virtual\nMuseums’, but the first three there given are the\nGoogle World Wonders site, the Vatican Museums\nCollections Online site, and Europeana, all of which\nwere created independently of V-MUST. One is left\nto wonder just what was made by V-MUST. It does\nappear that the partners did make something called\nthe ‘Keys of Rome’ (http://www.v-must.net/activ-\nities/keys-rome-city-augustus). This was an ‘exhib-\nition’, ‘virtual’ at least in part (how much cannot be\ndetermined), mounted ‘in parallel’ in four locations.\nIt is not clear what ‘in paralleP? means. We are told\nthat the exhibition opened in Rome between 24 and\n28 September 2014, and was ‘subsequently hosted in\nthe other locations’. This project declares that it is\n‘the result of a four-years joint cooperation between\nresearchers and developers of the V-MUST project’.\nFor all this effort, all that seems to remain is a I-min\n45-s video at — https://player.vimeo.com/video/\n75944494, A separate page lists technologies relevant\nto virtual museums, some of which appear to have\nbeen developed by V-MUST: several of these are in-\ncomplete, while others have broken links. There are,\nof course, special circumstances around European\nfunding, which places a premium on inter-nation\npartnership. However, this seems less than was\npromised.\n\nIt can be argued that the problems with the\nQuartos and V-MUST projects point up inadequa-\ncies with the collaborative project model itself.

First, throughout the book, collaboration\nis seen as occurring within project frames: as if\nwithout defined projects, there can be no collabor-\nation. A moment’s thought shows this is untrue: we\ncollaborate all the time, in our professional lives, in\nour lives everywhere, most of this collaboration\noccurring outside anything which looks like a ‘pro-\nject’. Second, in example after example, collabor-\nation is seen as between different disciplines\n(typically, between ‘humanists’ and computer en-\ngineers), not within a discipline.

Third, most seriously, there is no critique, no\ndifferentiation, of collaboration. Not all collabor-\nations are productive: all too many end badly.\nWhy? Are all within a collaboration equal? How\nare decisions to be made; should there be leaders;\nhow should they lead?\n\nA single example might point up the deficiencies\nin the model of collaboration offered by\nDigital_Humanities. In the first lines of Dante’s\nInferno the speaker relates:\n\n“Midway in the journey of our life\nI came to myself in a dark wood,\n\nFrom the work of many scholars and commentators,\nnow available in a few moments with a search\nengine, the reader may learn that the time is just\nbefore dawn on Good Friday, 1300, when Dante was\nin the 35th year of his life, halfway through the\nbiblical span of 3 score and 10. From other indica-\ntions in the poem and scholar’s commentary, it ap-\npears that the sun is at the spring equinox in the\nsign of Aries, and that the moon is full, confirming\nthe rebirth and regeneration implied by the Easter\nseason. In addition, scholars demonstrate that there\nwas no Friday in 1300, and certainly not that Good\nFriday, in which all these conditions obtained, sug-\ngesting from the first lines that Dante’s vision is\nboth rooted in and surpassing the actual and phys-\nical world.’ All of this would be helpful and use-\nful for any reader.

Yet, it may be argued that the Dante schol-\narship creating this knowledge is actually more truly\n‘collaborative’ than that in (for example) the\nQuartos project, where some participants were\npaid for their services (thus, the contractors respon-\nsible for the initial text capture of the editions and,\none presumes, the transcribers who added encoding\nto the captured text) and others appear to have done\nno more than attend the initial project meeting. All\nthese commentators and scholars, working across\ncenturies and continents, had and have a single\ncommon aim: to contribute to the understanding\nof Dante’s poem, by any means available. The fact\nthat most of them never met and never could meet\ndoes not make their collaboration any less real and\nliving.\n\nWe may now return to the question set earlier in\nthis essay. Given that we wish to make editions\nwhich are ‘social’, in that they may draw upon the\nskills and knowledge of all who may wish to con-\ntribute, ‘digital’, in that they are based on computer\nplatforms, and ‘scholarly’, in that they meet the\nhighest scholarly standards, should we work to\nthe ‘collaborative project? model, as seen in so\nmany projects and as advocated by the\nDigital Humanities authors, or should we seek\nsome other model? Let us presume that we want\nto create an edition which would offer access to\nimages and transcriptions of every page of every\nsurviving first folio and quarto print of\nShakespeare plays: somewhere over a thousand\nbooks in total.’ One can conceive a single large col-\nlaborative project that does this, as indeed the ori-\nginal Shakespeare Quartos proposal imagined for\nthe Quartos.? There would be a central group of\npartners, drawn from the major institutions and\nincluding leading Shakespeare scholars, expanding\nas more and more people and groups joined the\nproject, and deploying crowd-sourcing systems to\npermit students and readers at every level to con-\ntribute. Standards groups would prescribe imaging,\ntranscription, and interface conventions; technical\n\nL8/r/ Lereoiuepysp/uico dno owepeoe/y:sdyu uo pepeojumog]\n\nS,\n\nZOZ sequeced gO UO Jasn Aueigr] Ausieaiur euUalA Aq ggzeogzs\n\n8\n\f"

            "result": "groups would provide complex and powerful infra-\nstructures to mount and maintain the project. There\nwould be clear lines of reporting to the funding\nagencies, which would know exactly what they\nwere getting. The collaboration between\nShakespeare scholars, the general public, and com-\nputing experts would be a model for all; there would\nbe major project launches, Gannt charts, planning\nand progress meetings, press releases, with the cen-\ntrality of Shakespeare to our culture, and the high\nprofile of the partner institutions drawing world-\nwide attention, all in turn promoting the concept\nof the large collaborative project as offering unpar-\nalleled access for everybody to materials of the high-\nest cultural value.\n\nWhat can be wrong with this? First, it would be\nvery expensive. The Quartos project, addressing\nonly some thirty-two copies (most, already digi-\ntized), received grant funding of some $119,598\nfrom the transatlantic JISC/NEH partnership.\nScaling that for over a thousand copies, in many\nmore places, with many of them requiring individ-\nual negotiation and digitization, so implying a pro-\nject extending years into the future, would multiply\nthis massively. Even if one were to find all this\nmoney (not an impossibility, given the high status\nof Shakespeare), one could not apply this model to\nother authors, other bodies of material, which do\nnot have the name Shakespeare attached to them.\nFurther, the result for this would be a ‘project’, with\na discrete identity and interface. Whitney Trettien,\nreviewing various attempts at the application of\ndigital methods to Shakespeare, comments on the\ninterface provided by the Quartos archive:\n\n[T]he more functionalities the archive itself\nprovides, the more it traps the user within\nits own walls ... the analogy to the reading\nroom — a space of archival containment,\nwhere one must view materials under the\nwatchful eyes of the archon, using only those\ntools pre-approved and provided by the li-\n\nbrary ~ is eerily apt (2010, 398-9)\n\nIn theory, one could mend this by suggesting to the\nproject partners the additional tools and interfaces\nneeded—or, by becoming one of the project team,\nand making these changes directly. In practice, the\n\nProject-based digital humanities\n\nproject might not have the resources to provide the\nadditional functionality. The interface for the\nQuartos archive has not changed in several years\nnow, and, absent further funding, is unlikely to\nchange anytime soon. Trettien comments on how\nthe approach taken by projects like the Quartos\narchive tends to ‘rigidify[...] the methodologies of\nearly humanities computing into “projects,” prod-\nucts constructed and disseminated along an artificial\ntimeline’ (p. 391). Pace the enthusiasm of the\nDigital_Humanities authors, large projects tend to\nbe bureaucratic, slow moving, and mired in institu-\ntional caution. Moreover, the fundamental problem\nwith the collaborative project model remains: it is\ncollaborative only for people who are within the\nproject. No matter how open the structures, no\nmatter how welcoming the culture, there will be\npeople who will choose not to become part of the\nproject.\n\nThere is an alternative. Imagine that instead of a\nsingle Great Project we have a host of people, some\nworking within separate ‘projects’, some within in-\nstitutions (libraries, universities, archives, schools),\nmany working on their own with nothing more than\ntheir own interest and an internet connection. One\nmay presume that among the millions who each\nyear teach, read, and study Shakespeare, attend or\ntake part in performances on stage or screen, there\nwill be many who have the desire and the ability to\ncontribute to the study of Shakespeare’s text, in all\nits manifestations. Consider again the example of\nthe first lines of the Commedia, where generations\nof individual scholars, working independently, have\ncontributed to the understanding of these lines. Can\nwe transpose this model to the digital world, so that\nall the research we need might be done by many\npeople, each contributing their own polyp to a\nrising coral reef of Shakespeare scholarship?'®\n\nIndeed, one could argue: this is already happen-\ning. Over half of all the quarto copies of Shakespeare\nplays (442 of 777 in 2010, according to Kuhn f.n. 6)\nhave already been digitized. Transcripts of some of\nthese are already available, at various places: some,\nhowever flawed, in Quartos Archive itself; others at\nthe Internet Shakespeare Editions site (http://inter-\nnetshakespeare.uvic.ca/).

Perhaps we do not need to do\nanything at all, but leave it to all these individuals to\ndo as they will. A few moments with the internet,\nhowever, shows the limitations of this laissez-faire\napproach. Consider, for example, the Folger quar-\ntos: it appears, from Kuhn f.n. 10, that all 218 copies\nhave been digitized. But it is extremely difficult for\neven an experienced scholar to find these digital\ncopies. As of June 2014, one had to click on the\nlink “Using the collection’ at http://www.folger.\nedu/; then on the link to ‘Digital Image\nCollection’ to bring you to a page which speaks of\nsome ‘75,000’ digital images, highlighting various\nimages (letters written by Elizabeth I, photographs,\nand promptbooks), but offering no direct link to the\nquarto images. Instead, one is offered a link to a\nLuna imaging interface, offering many things but\nnot any obvious route to any quarto or other\ncopies. Typing ‘quarto’ into the Luna search box\ngives many results—but no quarto copies are visible.\nTyping ‘quarto copy’ reduces the results to nineteen,\nand indeed produces something which looks like a\nquarto copy, but turns out to be an 1858 facsimile\nreprint. The site also suggests installing a stand-\nalone Luna imaging client, which might offer\nbetter access: I could not manage to install that\nclient. As it happened, I had a link to http://tita-\nnia.folger.edu/impositor/search.php#, which offered\nthe suggestion: ‘Hint: Include “STC” in the query to\nlimit results to books in the STC’. As all the quarto\ncopies are indeed catalogued in the Short Title\nCatalogue, this provides a way in, and indeed, a\nsearch for ‘STC Hamlet’ in Luna produces 804 re-\nsults, many of which are manifestly links to quarto\ncopies. But discovery of exactly which results refer\nto which copies, filtering out those which link to\nmodern facsimiles, and those which are duplicate\nlinks to the same copy, is a lengthy process.\n\nMore than an hour of searching the Folger\nsystem for the 218 copies failed to turn up more\nthan a handful of them. It turns out the best way\nto find the copies is by using the STC number: so\nsearching for ‘STC 22276 in the Luna system takes\nyou immediately to the sixty-five images of the 1604\nquarto. However, you have to know to look for the\nSTC number. Then, you have to know the STC\n\n884 = Digital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016\n\nnumber, and to find this, you have to know rather\nexactly just what you are searching for. My own\nsearch of the STC at http://estc.bluk/for\n‘Shakespeare Hamlet? and the year 1604 did\nindeed find the volume, and gave the golden\nnumber ‘22276’ as a ‘citation reference’. A search\nengine which requires that you know exactly what\nyou are looking for before you can find it is not very\nhelpful. The Folger is a major library, with consid-\nerable resources and a sophisticated web presence.\nOne hesitates at the effort that would be required to\nfind all the other digital copies in all the other\nlibraries.\n\nLeaving matters as they are, with a multitude of\nlibraries creating digital copies and making them\navailable through a plethora of different systems,\nwith scholars building references and other resources\non these copies, will lead at best to a patchwork, with\nsome areas well covered, others not at all, and much\nuneven ground between. We have been speaking of\nthe Shakespeare Quartos. Replace ‘Shakespeare’ with\nDante, Chaucer, Milton, or any author, any field of\nliterature or history, and we see different versions of\nthe same: a mess of many documents, some of them\nwith digital surrogates and instantly accessible, some\nburied within complex catalogues, with clouds of\ncommentary around the documents, in blogs, in art-\nicles, in social media comments, and more. Search\nengines have achieved extraordinary advances, and\ncollaborative sites such as Wikipedia and its relatives\ngo some way to drawing together disparate re-\nsources—but only some way.\n\nHow, then, can we do better? We have already\nruled out the approach offered by what one might\nterm the ‘one collaborative project does it all’. Even\nless promising are the large infrastructure projects\nwe have seen over the last years, claiming to offer\nmassive progress to all the problems of digital re-\nsource creation, discoverability, access, and main-\ntenance which now characterize the world of\ndigital cultural resources (thus, the DARIAH,\nCLARIN, and BAMBOO projects), but which have\nso far given birth to rather less than a mouse (Van\nZundert, 2012). Nor is leaving things as they are an\noption: surely we can do better.\n\nRay Siemens has suggested that the next move in\nthe digital humanities will be towards what he calls\n\nL8/r/ Lereoiuepysp/uico dno owepeoe/y:sdyu uo pepeojumog]\n\nS,\n\nZOZ sequeced gO UO Jasn Aueigr] Ausieaiur euUalA Aq ggzeogzs\n\n8\n\f"

He suggests this\nwill be ‘more inclusive’, moving digital humanities\n‘into the larger community’, and that it will be an\n‘action-oriented agenda’ (2013, at the 34-min\nmark). Accordingly, we need to find a way of work-\ning together, more productively and more effi-\nciently. I suggest that in place of ‘the collaborative\nproject’, as the core model for our work at the inter-\nsection of digital methods and the humanities, we\nmake ‘design for generosity’ the template for what\nwe do. The term ‘design for generosity’ is associated\nwith Clay Shirky, and is linked to his well-known\nideas about ‘cognitive surplus’ (2008, 2010a,b). In\nhis account, we can only deploy our ‘cognitive sur-\nplus’, using our free time and knowledge to contrib-\nute to collaborative activities, because of the\nexistence of a range of tools which are designed\nfor generosity. Wikipedia exists because its founders\nput together a series of software and hardware sys-\ntems that would allow people to write, rewrite, find,\nrefine, and republish encyclopaedia articles. Indeed,\none can see the whole internet, as first founded in\nthe late 60s, as an instance of design for generosity:\nfrom the outset, the internet was designed so that it\ncould be infinitely extensible. Berners-Lee built on,\nand extended yet further, this design for generosity,\nby lowering the barriers so that web pages can be\nmade and published with minimal resources. In\nrecent years, the new giants of this post-industrial\nage, Facebook and Google, have built vast empires\non this model, on the calculation that giving away\ntheir key technologies so that people could make\nweb pages or find what they want on the web\nwould create business opportunities down the line:\na gamble so successful that in a few years they\nbecame among the most valuable companies in\nhistory.\n\nTo adapt Shirky, imagine that we devote a frac-\ntion of the time we spend with search engines or\nmaking social media pages to working on\nShakespeare Quartos. What could we not achieve?\nOne can readily conceive a collaborative enterprise,\nto identify, create, and enrich digital resources\nrelated to the Quartos which is not a single collab-\norative project, but a looser network designed for\ngenerosity, offering a space which will grow as\nothers contribute. The internet is itself such a\n\nProject-based digital humanities\n\nnetwork, but we need special tools for special\ntasks. Within our domain of digital humanities,\nthe Transcribe Bentham project has given an excel-\nlent instance of the harnessing of ‘cognitive surplus’\nfor a well-defined task. The Interedition project has\nalso taken notable steps in this direction, with its\nconcept of a loosely knit suite of ‘web services’\nwhich could be readily used by others in the\nmaking of collaborative online editions. One may\nalso. point to enterprises such as Omeka,\nHyperCities, the ARC (2012) projects, and the\n‘Commons in a Box’ (2012; among many) as initia-\ntives which can indeed be used along design for\ngenerosity principles: they may be developed in\nways never contemplated by their creators.\nHowever, we need more. If we use these tools only\nto make closed collaborations we will not have\nchanged anything. The Transcribe Bentham project\nis a case in point. Anyone may join, and anyone may\nchoose what to transcribe from the materials made\navailable on the site, using the tools and according\nto the specifications provided by the site’s creators.\nThere is nothing incompatible with design for gen-\nerosity principles in this. However, it appears that\nthe transcriptions, once done, are ‘locked’ by the site\nmanagers, and they are no longer available to the\noriginal transcribers, or indeed to anyone else apart\nfrom the Bentham editors. This is made clear in the\nanswer to the question ‘Why should I take part?’\nposed on the ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ page of\nthe Bentham site (2011): the transcripts will ‘act as a\nbasis for future editions’ of Bentham; they will be\nuploaded to a digital repository where they will be\npart of a mass of Bentham material ‘opening up the\nBentham collection for everyone’. That is, the\nBentham editors will control how the materials are\nused. In doing so, they are behaving as editors\nalways have behaved: acting to ensure the quality\nof the work, then arranging for it to be published.\nHowever, what looks normal in the print world, in\nthe context of traditional scholarly editing with its\nhierarchy of publisher, scholar, students, and read-\ners, looks very different in the world of Web 2.0.\nThe transcribers who contribute to the Bentham site\nare not students, undertaking this work as part of a\nclass or other exercise, nor are they collaborating\nscholars. They are individuals willingly giving their\n\nDigital Scholarship in the Humanities, Vol. 31, No. 4, 2016 885\n\nL8/r/ Lereoiuepysp/uico dno owepeoe/y:sdyu uo pepeojumog]\n\nS,\n\nZOZ sequeced gO UO Jasn Aueigr] Ausieaiur euUalA Aq ggzeogzs\n\n8\n\f"

There are many circumstances in\nwhich this difference will not matter: when individ-\nuals agree with the aims of the controlling editors,\nor are indifferent to them. But there are circum-\nstances where this will matter. If contributors feel\nthat their work is being used for the narrow advan-\ntage of others, they will feel that their generosity is\nbeing abused.\n\nGenerosity means more than the right to feel that\nothers are not appropriating your work. It means a\ngift with no conditions. If I do a transcription for\nthe Bentham project, or index Shakespeare Quartos\non the web, I should like anyone else to be able to\ntake what I have done and use it for their own pur-\nposes—even if those purposes are actually very dif-\nferent from, and perhaps even opposed to, my own.\nShirky (2010a) epitomizes this aspect of generosity\nby ‘lolcats’: if we enable creative collaboration by\ndesign for generosity, acts of the highest civic\nvalue may come—but so too may come ‘the stupid-\nest possible creative act’, a lolcat. You cannot, he\ninsists, have one without the other. Within the acad-\nemy, we may cast this as the difference between a\n‘collaboration’, with an agenda which precludes\nwhat its leaders regard as wrong, and a “commu-\nnity’, where individual members may act in very\ndifferent, and often opposing ways. Translating\nthis to Shakespeare Quartos, we may imagine a\ncommunity of people identifying copies, digitizing\nthem, transcribing, and indexing them, making all\nthis available for others to use in any way they want.\nOne can imagine too, in parallel, a host of scholars\nbuilding their own editions, commentaries, and\nscholarship on all these materials, so freely given,\nand in return offering those back to the community\nfor others to use. It is a picture not so different, after\nall, from the way scholarly communities have always\nworked, as the instance of our understanding of the\nfirst lines of the Commedia shows—but now hugely\nenhanced in possibilities, as we may give and ex-\nplore on a scale and with a speed never before im-\naginable. It is also very close to the way in which the\nopen-source software communities work, with mul-\ntiple individuals contributing materials freely avail-\nable to all, which networks of companies (many\nemploying many of these same individuals) then\nexploit in many ways, and with continuing liberal\n\ninterchange between what is freely given and what is\ncommercially owned. A few moments with an\nonline travel booking site may show the miracles\nwhich can be created by this merger of the free\nand the owned, as travel providers everywhere\nopen up their booking databases so that multiple\nand flourishing booking engines may compete to\noffer the best access to anyone who wants to travel\nanywhere. One may imagine a Travelocity for the\nShakespeare quartos, permitting us to go instantly\nto any line of any play in any quarto, or all the\nquartos for any one line, or all the lines in any\none quarto—and then, an Expedia, an Orbitz,\neach trying to do the same but better.\n\nThere are two important steps scholars and digi-\ntal humanists in the academy may make towards\nthese aims. The first step will cost very little: it is\nsimply that all scholarly projects creating funda-\nmental edition data (images, descriptions, transcrip-\ntions, and indices) should make these available\nunder the Creative Commons Attribution license\n(CC BY’). This will allow others to reuse all we\ndo, and give it new life in new contexts, to create\na collective and accumulating resource for us all.\nThe second step is that not only should we free\nour work from inappropriate licensing but we\nshould make it really available through really access-\nible interfaces (such as well-documented, and ideally\ninteroperable APIs) so that others can combine, re-\norganize, enrich, and republish whatever we do, in\nany way they like, just as travel companies now rou-\ntinely open their databases to web engines.\n\nIt has to be said that, up to now, the record of\nmajor scholarly and digital humanities agencies in\nrelation to these two steps is poor, even lamentable.\nConcerning the first step, the Shakespeare Quartos\narchive may be defective in some ways, but in this\nrespect it is to be applauded, as all the XML tran-\nscripts in the edition are available for download,\nalbeit with the ‘non-commercial’ restriction.\nUnfortunately, despite Harold Short’s assertion\nthat ‘dozens, if not hundreds’ of digital humanities\nprojects make their data freely available in accord-\nance with this license, the Shakespeare Archives is\nvery much the exception.'!

Our record with the second step is yet\nworse: where data are made available (as in the\nShakespeare Archives and the three Kings projects)\nit is through download from a URL (or rather, a\nseries of discrete URLs, each of which the reader\nmust find), and not through a transparent com-\nputer-accessible interface. I do not know of a\nsingle digital edition project which offers an inter-\nface that enables automated harvesting of digital\nedition data.\n\nScholars, like people everywhere, will always act\nin what they perceive as their own interest. The col-\nlaborative project model, with its ingredients of\nscholarly control and orderly assignment of credit,\nplays well with traditional notions of scholarly inter-\nest. Indeed, there will always be a place for projects\nbuilt to this model, as beacons of excellence, and as\nexpressions of vital scholarly concern. However, edi-\ntions made this way will be narrowly social. As well\nas a patchwork of collaborations, we need a geog-\nraphy of communities, with many people in many\nplaces contributing freely. Communities do not just\nhappen: they need leadership and they need infra-\nstructure. Scholars and the academy may provide\nboth elements, and may do more than this: they\nmay create and foster a culture of generosity. This\nwill not be easy. My own attempts to persuade sev-\neral major editorial projects to adopt the CC BY\nlicense have met with considerable resistance, as\nscholars find it difficult to accept that others\nmight freely take the work into which they have\ninvested such effort and use it in ways they do not\napprove. However, the potential is great. Editions\nwhich are all three of ‘social’, ‘scholarly’, and\n‘digital’ may enable editions to be made on a scale\nand of a variety never before seen. In their making,\nwe may see a reworking of the compacts between\nscholar and reader, between the academy and the\ncommunity, to enrich the readership of all and to\naffirm the value of scholarship in the digital age.\n\nProject-based digital humanities\n\nReferences\n\nARC.

SAMPLE\n\ndigital tools and the methodologies afforded by those tools that have otherwise been\na boon to literary scholars working on earlier eras of American literature?\n\nOr, as I said, what have the digital humanities failed to notice about Don DeLillo?\n\nIshould clarify this question, though, lest it seem too specific. DeLillo is merely\na convenient stand-in. We might just as easily substitute for his name any other\ntowering figure of late twentieth- and carly twenty-first-century American litera-\nture: Toni Morrison, Philip Roth, Dan Brown. The results will be the same. Unless\none is willing to infringe on copyright, break a publisher’s DRM, or wait approxi-\nmately four generations when these authors’ works will likely fall into the pub-\nlic domain, barring some as of yet unknown though predictable act of corporate\nAmerica Congress, the kind of groundbreaking work being done on seventeenth-,\neighteenth-, nineteenth-, and even twentieth-century literature simply will not hap-\npen for DeLillo and his contemporaries.' Digital editions, online archives, text min-\ning, data visualizations—these are the bread and butter of scholars working on pre-\ntwentieth-century literature within the digital humanities. As Andrew Jewell and\nAmy Earhart explain in their introduction to a recent collection called The Ameri-\ncan Literature Scholar in the Digital Age, “utilizing digitization and computational\npower makes possible new ways of seeing, collecting, editing, visualizing, and ana-\nlyzing works of literature. These new methods are at the core of professional aca-\n\n \n\ndemic life, altering not only what we can read through unprecedented access to\ntextual information but also how we articulate our scholarly response to materials”\n(Zarhart and Jewell, 2). This is all true, but like most truths it is not true for all. It\nis not true for scholars of DeLillo’s work, which stands apart from the dominant\nmethodological and analytical advances of the digital humanities.\n\nAlthough it’s risky to generalize about the digital humanities, it is safe to say\nthat the work of the digital humanities is ultimately premised upon a simple, prac-\ntical fact: it requires a digital object, either a born-digital object or an analog object\nthat has been somehow scanned, photographed, mapped, or modeled in a digital\nenvironment. In the context of literary studies, this usually means a large corpora\nof digitized texts, such as the complete works of Shakespeare, the multiple versions\n\n \n\nof Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, or every single book published in England during\nthe nineteenth century.\n\nNone of this is available in any substantive, legal way for DeLillo’s work, nor\nwill it be. There is no debate about that. It is indisputable.”\n\nBut what if ] were wrong?\n\nWhat if there was a world in which the digital humanities could lend its con-\nsiderable institutional and collaborative weight to the study of DeLillo’s fiction?\n\nLet us imagine, then, several alternate histories of DeLillo’s work. First, an offi-\ncial publication history, the seamless kind that every scholarly monograph on De-\nLillo reproduces, though my version will already begin to tug at loose threads. Then\na second history, one we might think of as DeLillo’s latent history, those events that\nremain “unseen and unremarked on,” revealed only by archival research of largely\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:48 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

And finally, let us take this notion of\nlatent history to its logical conclusion, going beyond recovering what has been\nunseen and unremarked on to imagining the “potential events” of DeLillo’s his-\ntory, which would be “more important than real events,” redefining DeLillo stud-\nies, not to mention our entire understanding of contemporary American literature.\n\nTimeline I: Excerpt from DeLillo’s Official Publication History\n\n(This is not a Timeline. This is an Argument.)\n\n1960\n\nDon DeLillo, a young copywriter at the legendary Ogilvy and Mather Advertising\nAgency, publishes his first short story, “The River Jordan,” in Epoch, a literary jour-\nnal out of Cornell University. “The River Jordan” has never been republished. There\nis no electronic version of Epoch.\n\n1968\n\nDeLillo publishes “Baghdad Towers West,” also in Epoch. By 1968, Epoch has pub-\nlished four out of five of DeLillo’s earliest short stories. “Baghdad. Towers West” has\nnever been republished. There is no electronic version of Epoch.\n\n1970\n\nDeLillo publishes “The Uniforms,” a rewriting of Godard’s 1967 film Weekend (VHS\navailable from Amazon.com for $94.95 new). “The Uniforms” appears in the Caro-\nlina Quarterly, digital copies of which exist for volumes 55 and on. “The Uniforms”\nwas published in volume 22.\n\n1972\n\nSports Illustrated publishes “Total Loss Weekend,’ DeLillo’s story of a man whose\nwagers on dozens of college and pro sporting events on a single October week-\nend conclude with “misery, paranoia, bitterness, defeat” (100). Though no DeLillo\nscholar has ever recognized this curious fact, “Total Loss Weekend” is DeLillo’s sec-\nond appearance in Sports Illustrated. His first appearance was earlier the same year,\nwhen the first eight chapters of End Zone (1972) were published under the awk-\nward title “Pop, Pop, Hit Those People.” This was the April 17, 1972, issue, with a\nvictorious Jack Nicklaus on the cover and the story itself interspersed with adver-\ntisements for Spalding golf balls, La Corona filter tips, and Puerto Rican rum.

These two texts are the only pieces of DeLillo’s short fiction to be\navailable digitally until “Midnight in Dostoevsky” appears on the New Yorker web-\nsite thirty-seven years later.\n\nThese two stories were not, of course, available digitally that whole time; they\nwent online only when Time Warner opened the Sports Illustrated Vault in 2008.\nReading straight from the Web 2.0 playbook with nonsensical phrases that have\nbeen attached to new digital initiatives throughout the ages, Jeff Price, the president\nof Sports Illustrated Digital describes the Sports Ilustrated Vault: “By combining\nSl archives with cutting-edge technology, web tools and sport functionality search\ncapability [sic] we have created a destination that will grow through the active par-\nticipation of site visitors and through search engine discovery” (“Sports Illustrated\nVault Debuts”).\n\n1973\n\n“The Uniforms” is reprinted in Cutting Edges: Young American Fiction for the ‘70s.\n“The Uniforms” is the only stand-alone story of DeLillo’s ever to be republished.\nCutting Edges is available in 198 libraries worldwide, none of them near you. In an\nappendix to Cutting Edges, DeLillo notes that he wrote “The Uniforms” as “a chal-\nlenge to writers of radical intent” (533), who ought to experiment with the form of\nthe novel. DeLillo explains,\n\nFiction is trying to move outward into space, science, history and technology.\nIt's even changing its typographical contours. Writers want their stories to be\ntouched, petted, and, in some cases, sexually assaulted. In a cellar in Ludwig-\nshafen, a ninety-four-year-old printer has been working for two decades on\ndifferent mediums of type—malleable, multidimensional, pigmented. Type as\npaint. Dark colors for somber words. Books the size of refrigerators. (“Appendix\nto “The Uniforms,” 532)\n\nIt is entirely fitting that DeLillo imagines the future of the book in terms of the\nlargest of kitchen appliances, the massive, humming refrigerator. Fitting, because as\nmuch as DeLillo has been an astute observer of the media age, meditating time and\ntime again upon the meaning of technology in modern American lives, he himself\nhas been personally resistant to digital technology, choosing to write on the same\nmanual Olympia typewriter for the past forty years. No lightweight Kindles or sleek\niPads figure in DeLillo’s premonitions of the future of the book.\n\n(DeLillo’s most recent seven novels are available as downloadable Kindle\ne-books.

In the let-\nter to DeLillo’s agent, the magazine’s legendary fiction editor Roger Angell kindly\nhopes that “Mr. DeLillo won't be too disappointed by this rejection, for he has a\ngood deal to be optimistic about. I think he may have a considerable future as a\nwriter” (Angell, 1).\n\nAlso in 1966, the Kenyon Review accepts the short story “Cinema” for publi-\ncation, though the journal recommends that DeLillo consider changing the title to\n“Coming Sun. Mon. Tues.” The Kenyon Review also suggests removing the “page\n3 reference to Dachau” (Macauley, 1). DeLillo replaces “Dachau” with “Vietnam or\nMississippi” in the final version.\n\n1969\n\nJack Hicks, the editor of the Carolina Quarterly, appreciates the “Godard touches\nand murmurs” of “The Uniforms” and accepts it for publication at five dollars per\npage (1969, “Letter to Don DeLillo, 1).\n\n1971\n\nJack Hicks contacts DeLillo about an anthology called Routines (published in 1973\nas Cutting Edges), which will include “The Uniforms.” Hicks asks DeLillo for mate-\nrial for the appendix of the anthology, which should include a “frame of reference”\nfor the story, as well as some thoughts about “what fiction should/will do in the\n1970s” (1971, “Letter to Don DeLillo,” 1).\n\nIt is in this “frame of reference” for “The Uniforms” that DeLillo imagines that\n“in a cellar in Ludwigshafen, a ninety-four-year-old printer has been working for\ntwo decades on different mediums of type—malleable, multidimensional, pig-\nmented” (“Appendix to ‘The Uniforms,” 532). Explaining why he turned a Godard\nfilm into a short story, DeLillo argues that “thousands of short stories and novels\nhave been made into movies. I simply tried to reverse the process. Until elastic type\nis perfected, I submit this mode of work as a legitimate challenge to writers of radi-\ncal intent” (533). Twice in DeLillo’s 325-word “frame of reference,” he evokes the\nnotion of malleability, elasticity. Throughout his career, DeLillo will consistently\nseek elasticity in the source material for his fiction. He will not, however, embrace\n“elastic type” of the kind that digital technology makes readily possible.\n\n1972\n\nEnd Zone, with its first eight chapters appearing simultaneously in Sports [lustrated\n(see “Timeline I: Excerpt from Delillo’s Official Publication History”), is published.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:48 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

But the novel is just as eas-\nily a reflection on the role of the writer in the age of digital reproduction.\n\nIn DeLillo’s handwritten notes for Mao I, he writes “Reclusive Writer: In the\nworld of glut + bloat, the withheld work of art becomes the only meaningful object”\n(DeLillo, Notes in Notebook). Significantly, in the novel, DeLillo attributes this senti-\nment not to Bill Gray, the reclusive novelist at the heart of Mao I but to Scott, Gray’s\npersonal assistant and eventual archivist. “The withheld work of art is the only elo-\nquence left,” Scott tells Gray (67). And Scott will indeed withhold all Gray’s writ-\nings, hoarding them. Once Bill Gray leaves the country, becoming entangled with a\nterrorist organization, Scott sets to organizing Gray's papers. “He could arrange the\nreader mail geographically or maybe book by book,” Scott muses, “although there\nwas a great deal of mail that referred to both books or neither book” (143). Later\nScott goes about “restructuring the mail by country. Once that was done he would\nput each country in chronological order so he might easily locate a letter sent from\nBelgium, say, in 1972. There was no practical reason why he'd ever want to find such\na letter or any other piece of reader mail in particular. The point is that he would\nhave it all in place” (184). With his point “that he would have it all in place,” Scott’s\nactions lampoon the idea of an archive. What goes in and in what order and why is\narbitrary. In Mao IE, the archive is organized according to whimsical principles that\nreveal little about its contents. Order trumps the ordered.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:48 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[193\n\f"

I would think for a man who\nclearly reworks and refines as much as you do, a word processor would be a major\nblessing” (137-38). Later on the man persists with this praise of word processing,\ntelling Bill that “it’s completely liberating. You dom’t deal with heavy settled artifacts.\nYou transform freely, fling words back and forth” (164).\n\nHere the macro and the micro, the archive and the manuscript, both risk revi-\nsion; liberation; and, DeLillo seems to suggest, their very mooring onto meaning.\nIt is the return of the death of the author, replaced by what Barthes calls a “mod-\nern scriptor” who is “born simultaneously with the text? neither “preceding” nor\n“exceeding” it (145). Perhaps this is the danger of the digital for DeLillo but also\nits lure? Perhaps this is why Bill Gray must literally die toward the end of Mao II,\nbecause he refuses to die symbolically?\n\n1997\n\n“The reason | use a manual typewriter,’ DeLillo writes in a letter to David Foster\nWallace in 1997, “concerns the sculptural quality I find in words on paper, the archi-\ntecture of the letters individually and in combination, a sensation advanced (for me)\nby the mechanical nature of the process—finger striking key, hammer striking page.\nElectronic intervention would dull the sensuous gratification I get from this pro-\ncess—~a gratification I try to soak my prose in” (“Letter to David Foster Wallace,” 1).\n\n2003\n\nThe author, a doctoral student at the University of Pennsylvania, attends a DeLillo\nreading at the Philadelphia Free Library. As DeLillo signs a copy of Cosmopolis, the\nauthor thrusts a sealed letter into DeLillo’s hands that begins, “Please forgive this\nclumsy introduction—a sealed letter thrust into the hands of an unsuspecting nov-\nelist might very well appear as a scene in one of your novels” (Sample, 1) The letter\ngoes on to explain that the author is writing his dissertation on DeLillo’s early fiction\nand “would welcome the opportunity to talk or correspond with you about your\nfiction.” Grimacing and looking more than a little perturbed, DeLillo brusquely tells\nthe author that “everything I have to say about my books is in my books.”\n\nA week later a letter arrives from New York, addressed to the author, typed\non manual Olympia typewriter by Don DeLillo, in which DeLillo repeats, more\nkindly this time, that he prefers not to revisit his novels: “Pm not a student of my\nown fiction and I dort necessarily want to know everything that’s happening there,\nor everything that may be swimming the space between the reader and the book”\n(“Letter to Mark Sample,” 1).\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:48 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

He held on to those pages, even\nfor early drafts, and they piled, piled up high: “I want those pages nearby,’ DeLillo\ntold the Paris Review in 1993, “because there’s always a chance I'll have to refer to\nsomething that’s scrawled at the bottom of a sheet of paper somewhere. Discarded\npages mark the physical dimensions of a writer’s labor-—you know, how many shots\nit took to get a certain paragraph right” (Begley, 281).\n\nRecords, archives, the “physical dimensions” of the page, and the evidence of a\n“writer's labor” DeLillo’s work is shot through with these themes. This is one reason\nBill Gray abhors the “lightweight, malleable” form of word-processed text (161)—\nit leaves no trace. It is abstracted from the knowable world, unlike his typewriter\nwhere the long, meandering hours and days of his physical presence become inter-\ntwined with the machine, measured by the accumulation of hair: “hair that drifts\ninto the typewriter, each strand collecting dust along its lengths and fuzzing up\namong the hammers and interacting parts, hair that sticks to the felt mat the way a\nwinding fiber leeches on to soap so he has to gouge it out with a thumbnail, all his\ncells, scales and granules, all his faded pigment, the endless must of all this galling\nhair that’s batched and wadded in the works” (199).\n\nGoing on in the Paris Review interview, DeLillo speaks of the sheer physical\npresence of earlier drafts of work, of their “awesome accumulation, the gross ton-\nnage, of first draft pages. The first draft of Libra sits in ten manuscript boxes. I like\nknowing it’s in the house. I feel connected to it. It’s the complete book, the full expe-\nrience containable on paper” (Begley, 281).\n\nAs of 2004, those boxes and many more, and all the dust and detritus and\nsloughed-off cells among them, were no longer in DeLillo’s house. DeLillo’s papers,\nall of them, 125 boxes of material containing thousands of pages of DeLillo’s per-\nsonal and professional correspondence, handwritten notes, research materials,\ndrafts, and proofs were acquired for five hundred thousand doilars by the Harry\nRansom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nItis an old-fashioned archive. It is not digital and cannot be conquered by digital\nmieans. It is purely physical, like the “gross tonnage” of his drafts. Though the archive\nis open to the public, it will resist “electronic intervention.” As Richard Workman,\nan associate librarian at the Harry Ransom Center writes, “because most of our col-\nlections are under copyright, and because placement on the web is a form of publi-\ncation, we have special problems in this regard.

Just as the novel itself is unreadable, Ratner’s Star: The Legend of\nEndor’s Code is unplayable.\n\n2013\n\nAs part of the marketing campaign for David Cronenberg’s cinematic adaptation of\nDeLillo’s Cosmopelis (2003), the film studio tears with 42 Entertainment and the\nHarry Ransom Center to launch an ARG (alternate reality game) in which the Don\nDeLillo Papers play a key role. Core mechanics of the ARG include clues planted\nwithin the archive itself, such as letters from Murray Jay Siskind and other fictional\ncharacters, USB flash drives containing conversations between DeLillo and Cronen-\nberg, keys to safety deposit boxes, and maps to other locations where further clues\ncan be found.\n\nDeLillo on the Outside of the Digital Humanities\n\n“What does it all mean, signify, or demonstrate?” DeLillo wondered in 1971 in\nhis “frame of reference” for “The Uniforms” (“Appendix to “The Uniforms,” 533).\nWe might ask the same of these three timelines. What do they mean, signify, or\ndemonstrate?\n\nWhen I suggest that the digital humanities have failed scholars of Don DeLillo\nor other contemporary fiction, I am being unfair. The digital humanities are not\nresponsible, nor are digital humanists. As my timeline of potential events suggests,\nif there were readily available digital versions of DeLillo’s work, there would be no\nend to the computations that clever humanists could perform on them. Many of\nthese projects might have failed or been misguided and overreaching, yet I do not\ndoubt that the judicious use of visualizations, graphs, charts, maps, concordances,\nand other structures of meaning would reveal even greater depth to DeLillo’s work\nthan we already know to be there.\n\nBut the fact remains that the most promising, rewarded, or recognized work in\nthe digital humanities has centered upon texts and artifacts in the public domain.\nThe typical approaches to the digital humanities function quite well for medieval-\nists, Renaissance scholars, Victorianists, nineteenth-century Americanists, or even\nmodernists. Nearly everything scholars in these fields study is in the public domain\nand has been subjected to numerous and competing forms of digitization. But what\nif you study a living novelist, whose works are most decidedly copyrighted? What\nif you research a living novelist, whose life’s work resides not on hard drives but in\nboxes and boxes of notes, drafts, and manuscripts?\n\nThe failure of the digital humanities to which I refer in my chapter title is not\nthe failure to be able to do with DeLillo what we can do with Whitman or Blake. The\nfailure is simply that nobody is talking about this disconnect.

Of the three timelines I present,\nI much prefer the second, the exploration of DeLillo’s latent history, rooted in dust\nand documents, deterioration and decay.\n\nDeLillo has often said—and thematized in his novels—some version of his\nresponse to a question Anthony DeCurtis asked in a 1988 interview about being\nmarginal, or marginalized: “I think I have an idea of what it’s like to be an outsider\nin this society,” DeLillo told DeCurtis (DeCurtis, 288). In an undated letter to Jon-\nathan Franzen, DeLillo revisits this idea, telling the younger novelist that “a writer\nought to function as an outsider ... he ought to be skeptical about the values of\nsociety and ready to write in opposition to them” (“Letter to Jonathan Franzen,” 1).\n\nPerhaps it’s fitting, then, that DeLillo’s work will remain outside the culture of\nthe digital humanities. Perhaps there’s some value in a text or a collection of texts, a\nvast collection of texts, millions of words’ worth of texts, that cannot be accommo-\ndated by the latest trends in literary scholarship. A corpora that cannot be assimi-\nlated and reduced to a database or a graph, a body of texts accessible only through\nphysical engagement.\n\nI doubt anyone in this collection believes that it’s an either/or choice, that the\ndigital humanities is an all-or-nothing affair. Archival research can exist——and does\nexist—alongside digital editions, visualizations, modeling, and so on. What DeLillo\nteaches us, though, is that we ought to be skeptical. Just as DeLillo suggests that nov-\nelists should “be ready to write in opposition” to the values of society, scholars, too,\nshould be ready to study in opposition to the dominant values of contemporary\nscholarship. We may be surrounded by the digital in our reading, writing, teaching,\nand. scholarship, but we must not be circumscribed by it.* We must, I think, strive\nto remain cognizant of the latent and the potential realities of the digital humani-\nties. The potential is easy to see. The latent, by its very nature, is hidden. It is our\nmission to uncover it.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. DRM: digital rights management, any number of copy protection schemes used\nby publishers or distributors to ensure that e-books are not shared, loaned, or otherwise\nendowed with any resemblance to a physical book. My estimate of four generations of\ncopyright protection is based on current U.S. law, under which DeLillo’s first five novels\n(Americana through Players) are copyrighted until ninety-five years after their publica-\ntion date, while every novel published after 1977 (Running Dog through Point Omega) is\ncopyrighted seventy years beyond the death of the author—~the literal death of the author,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:48 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[199\n\f"

The dispute, however, is pointless. The HATHI Trust\nDigital Library and Google Books have both scanned some of DeLillo’s novels, a fact that\nwould appear to contradict my argument that DeLillo has been left behind by the dig-\nital humanities. But the limited range and depth of the functionality offered by either\nHATHI or Google only highlight their failure. HATHI has scanned exactly one DeLillo\nnovel, White Noise; that novel is full-text searchable, but the results show only page num-\nbers of the search terms. Google Book Search at least goes a step further, showing three-\nline “snippets” for ten of DeLillo’s fifteen novels. What Google offers is a glorified index\nof individual novels, useful for teaching and finding quick references but a shadow of the\nmassive text-mining and data-visualization operations upon which humanities comput-\ning has been built.\n\n3. John Unsworth has identified T. S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land” (1922) as both a lit-\neral and metaphorical demarcation between public domain texts that can be freely stud-\nied using the tools of the digital humanities and copyrighted texts that are far more diffi-\ncult to subject to nonconsumptive research—that is, research that relies on computational\nanalysis of a text rather than the reading of a text (see Unsworth). DeLillo’s work, as does\nthe work of every writer published in the United States since 1923, clearly dwells in a digi-\ntal waste land, a kind of forbidden territory tantalizingly out of reach for digital humanists.\n\n4.

            "result": "INTRODUCTION\n\nStudying Media through\nNew Media\n\nJentery Sayers\n\nThis Companion is about studying media through new media: for instance, making games to\nbetter understand their mechanics and politics, writing code and developing interfaces\nto explore their roles in reading and literacy, stewarding texts for online annotation and public\ndiscussion, participating in social networks to locate their biases and occlusions, assembling\nhardware to expose norms and change default settings, or composing audio, moving images,\ndatabases, and augmented reality applications as forms of scholarship at once similar to and\ndifferent from academic essays. That is quite a list. And it is not exhaustive. Yet it speaks to\n\n \n\nthe Companion’s principal impulse, which is to combine media studies with digital humanities to\nshare with readers (especially those who are new to both fields) the various types of research\nthat emerge.\n\nEven though they share interests in technologies, media studies and digital humanities do\nnot always converse. Perhaps this lack of dialogue is explained by divergent histories of theory\nand practice, with researchers in each field drawing from distinct canons and methodologies.\nIn digital humanities, studies of texts from the 1800s or earlier are quite common; for numerous\nreasons, these texts are readily available in electronic form and thus conducive to computational\nanalysis. In media studies, research tends to move from the 1800s forward and also focus on\n\n  \n\nnontextual forms, such as sound, images, video, and games. Aside from these differences in\nsubstance and period, popular definitions of each field suggest a difference in technique, too:\nwhereas media studies treats media and technologies as objects of inquiry, digital humanities\nintegrates them into its methods. Or, if media studies is about media and technologies, then\ndigital humanities works with them. Allow me to elaborate on this assumption for a moment.\n\nMany media studies practitioners avoid the reduction of research to instrumentalism, where\ntechnologies are “neutral tools” that simply turn input into output. Against instrumentalism,\npractitioners should be cognizant of not only the values and histories embedded in tech-\nnologies, but also how those values and histories shape interpretation. Related concerns in\nmedia studies include the risks of researchers colluding with the tech industry or adopting\ntechnologies too quickly. Early or enthusiastic adoption may be a knee-jerk endorsement of\nwhiz-bang gadgets and alluring trends—a way to make your project appealing or relevant\nto the market without necessarily addressing the research questions, social issues, concep-\ntual frameworks, matters of representation, and contexts of use at hand. Meanwhile, digital\n\f"

Technologies are constructed, maintained, preserved, and consumed,\nand they are intricately interlaced with labor and knowledge production in and beyond the\nacademy. In short, digital projects demand a lot of work. Where there’s a technology, there’s\n\n \n\nalso a team, some stories, millions of files, thousands of bugs and fixes, and plenty of politic\nThe result is significant attention to laboratory practices and technical competencies in digital\nhumanities.\n\nInspired by Tara McPherson’s seminal Cinema Journal essay, “Media Studies and the Digital\nHumanities” (2009), this Companion demonstrates how such assumptions about media\n\n   \n\nstudies and digital humanities are in reality hyperbolic, if not mythological. Many research-\ners, including contributors to this Companion, move routinely across the two fields, which\nmay mutually inform and enrich each other instead of fostering opposition. In fact, when\nthey are combined in theory as well as practice, we could say that media studies and digital\nhumanities work through new media as means and modes of inquiry. We can research media\n\n \n\nwithout resorting to naive enthusiasm for technologies or assuming scholarly positions from\non high, somehow above or outside the very conditions we study. More specifically, we may\nborrow language from scholars such as Wendy Hui Kyong Chun (2005) and Karen Barad\n(2007) to argue that we are entangled with the media we produce and research, not separate from\nthem. This position. need not imply a lack of researcher awareness or a disinterest in social\nchange. Rather, the point is to stress how all research is mediated; it is media all the way\ndown. We influence and are influenced by our inquiries and materials, and-—as exhibited by\neach chapter in this Companion——historicizing, assessing, and revising the roles media play\nin that influence renders our work more compelling and persuasive.\n\nWe might start by noting that “media” in this Companion is not synonymous with “the\n\n \n\nmedia,” or with communication outlets and conglomerates. As an alternative, we may begin\nwith Lev Manovich’s five-part definition of new media, even if his definition privileges formal\naspects over the contexts of functions and processe:\n\n \n\n+ New media are numerical representations (composed of digital code),\n\n+ They are modular (several distinct parts constitute an object),\n\n+ They are automated (their creation and maintenance involve a combination of people\nand machines),\n\n+ They are variable (versions eclipse originals and copies), and\n\n+ They are transcoded (a combination of computation and culture) (Manovich 2001:\n27-48).\n\nThis last aspect, transcoding, is most central to this Companion, which foregrounds the cul-\ntural dimensions of studying media through new media: how new media are about power and\ncontrol, for example. In doing so, the Companion also echoes W J.T. Mitchell: “There are\nno ‘pure’ media” (2008: 13). Even with established categories such as sound, image, video,\ntext, code, software, hardware, platform, interface, story, game, network, and even electricity,\nlight, or water, it is impossible to isolate one medium from the next. Their affordances are\nfleeting and incredibly difficult to measure. And if no pure media exist, then it is also im-\npossible to extract new media from the contingencies of their histories or settings, even as\n\n \n\nthey transform, rot, disappear, and reappear over time, often without provenance or reference\nto the motivations for their composition. While anyone may unconsciously or wilfully ignore\nthese histories and settings—these values and configurations—they are active ingredients of\n\ni)\n\f"

Once they enter our\nframe of analysis, new media’s formal or technical aspects morph from the common sense of\npatents, diagrams, and instruction manuals into a hairball of human and nonhuman activities\nor a matrix of technology and culture.\n\nWe could therefore propose that the study of media is the study of entanglements. How and\nunder what assumptions is sound entwined with image? Data with design? Network with\nnode? Old with new? Subject with object? Aesthetics with politics? This approach to com-\nbining media studies with digital humanities does not bypass specificity (as if entanglements\nare antithetical to granularity and difference), and it does not endorse relativism (as if en-\ntanglements either absolve us from responsibility or claim equal positioning for everyone\n\n \n\n \n\nand everything) (Haraway 1988: 584). It instead underscores how new media are simul-\ntaneously abstract and particular, inhabiting seemingly contradictory positions within systems\nthat invite and track action. It then asks us to account for where we are and how we participate\nin those systems—in the complex mesh of apparatus with process. This is no simple task\nespecially when we face the litany of things media may be: both social and material, carrier\n\n   \n\nand content, form and substance, portal and edge, ephemeral and permanent, you and\nother. Of course, practitioners usually select their preferred terms for research, and these\nterms unavoidably shape how people draw boundaries and assume responsibility for their\ndemarcations.\n\nMedia. A fascinating mess. In the following pages, four palpable issues repeatedly surface\nfrom. it all. These issues are not just concerns shared by some or even all the authors; they\nare also indicators of what makes the intersection of media studies with digital humanities\nunique and necessary right now.\n\n+ Beyond Text: With its prevalence in English departments and studies of literature and\nlanguage, digital humanities frequently deems text its primary medium for both com-\nposition and analysis. Against this grain, the following chapters give us a very concrete\nsense of digital humanities and media studies beyond text for inquiry. By extension, they\nprompt practitioners to consider an array of media in tandem with a constellation of\nmodalities, including listening, seeing, scanning, touching, skimming, hearing, watching,\n\n    \n\nsmelling, feeling, toggling, wearing, processing, and inhabiting. These modalities remind\nus how the study of media through new media is an embodied or material activity, which\nmay be both situated in and distributed across space and time as well as people and\nmachines. Embodiment (including questions of affect and labor) and materiality (including\nquestions of inscription, plasticity, and erasure) are fundamental to research as an\n\n \n\nentanglement.\n\n+ Labs and Collaboration: The laboratory, broadly defined, is a core component of many\nchapters in this Companion. A majority, if not all, of the methods are experimental.\nThey combine disciplines, privilege trial and error, underscore action in context, or\ndevelop custom technologies. Rarely is this work done alone, and even when the chapters\n\n \n\nare written by individuals they draw upon and acknowledge efforts by teams and\ncollectives. Although they are now ubiquitous features of digital work, labs and\ncollaboration remain understudied in the humanities. This Companion contributes\nadditional research to address that gap.\n\n+ Social Justice: The content of this Companion resists formal or technical treatments\nof media as if technologies are outside of time, history, culture, society, and material\nconditions. Many of the chapters focus on the entanglements of technologies with justice,\noppression, and power. Rather than asking what media are, they ask what media do.\n\f"

            "result": "JENTERY SAYERS\n\nHow do new media unfold in context? How are they made, by whom, and for whom?\nAccording to what norms or standards, and with what influence on social relations? With\nwhat acknowledgments and exclusions? How do they circulate, regulate, and discipline?\nHow are they modified or repurposed, and with what changes over time? These ques-\ntions encourage a media studies and digital humanities of the present moment, when\ntechnologies may be modes of activism and decolonization instead of instruments or\ngadgets.\n\n+ Expanding Participation: Instead of reducing media studies or digital humanities to\npractices such as programming—or to the technical particulars of code and platforms—\nthe chapters included here underscore a range of scholarly participation in new media\nfrom across disciplines and experiences. Through their methodologies, the authors may\nintervene in a given research area by prototyping media through new media, but they\n\nmay also conduct archival research, write monographs, pursue ethnographic methods, or\n\n \n\nmanage scholarly resources, for instance. One by-product of this range is a thorough\n\naccount of what “making,” “doing,” or “building” really mean in our current moment.\nThese forms of “active” participation need not be restricted to the creation of shiny,\ntangible, and measurable things. They need not rehearse the myth of lone white male\ninventors, either. Scholarship in this Companion involves (among other things) performing,\nwriting, thinking, speaking, listening, resisting, revising, editing, curating, maintaining,\nfixing, and tinkering, the particulars of which often escape us. Through this expansive\n\n  \n\napproach to participation in new media, the chapters more accurately reflect the actualities\n\nof research practice and move beyond the superficial hype of making and building stuff:\n\nTo give these four issues some structure, especially for readers who are new to media studies\nand digital humanities, I organized this Companion into five sections, followed by a Glossary\nof Acronyms and Initialisms as well as a Glossary of Projects mentioned in the chapters:\nPart I. Access, Praxis, Justice: This section highlights social justice issues that permeate\nthe entirety of the Companion. It also demonstrates how social justice work is enacted through\nnew media as a form of praxis, in part by expanding the definition of “access” through an\nemphasis on participation, but also by sharing various modes of activism involving new media.\nThis part features Tara McPherson on feminist film studies; Alexandra Juhasz on “ev-ent-\n\n \n\nanglement”; Moya Bailey and Reina Gossett on social media; Radhika Gajjala, Erika M.\nBehrmann, and Jeanette M. Dillon on cyberethnography; Aimée Morrison on public\nscholarship; Michelle Habell-Pallan, Sonnet Retman, Angelica Macklin, and Monica De La\nTorre on convivencia and archivista praxis; Roopika Risam on decolonization; Isabel Cristina\nRestrepo Acevedo on interactive narratives; Jacqueline Wernimont and Elizabeth Losh on a\n“long maker table”; Elizabeth Elicessor on glitch and disability; Amanda Phillips on videogames\nand social justice; and Elizabeth LaPensée on Indigenous game design.\n\nPart Il. Design, Interface, Interaction: Design, interfaces, and interaction are too often\nconsidered additive, as if they are features layered over code just before release. Against such\ntendencies, this section exhibits the centrality of design. to critical and creative inquiry with\nmedia. This part features Anne Balsamo on the cultural implications of design; Patrik Svensson\non the design of space; Kari Kraus on speculative design; Patrick Jagoda and Peter McDonald\non experience design and affective play; Mary Flanagan on critical play; Jessica Rajko on\nembodied thinking and wearables design; Kim Brillante Knight on wearable interfaces;\nMaureen Engel on deep mapping; and Beth Coleman on smart subjects in the Internet of\nThings.\n\f"

            "result": "INTRODUCTION\n\nPart HE. Mediation, Method, Materiality: Instead of treating media as containers that\ntransmit content, this section of the Companion attends to various forms of mediation, affect,\nand materiality important to humanities research. Many of the authors also translate mediation\n\n \n\ninto a method for inquiry. Here, mediation is not something delegated to instruments or\noverwritten by research techniques; it is what prompts interesting questions. This part features\nTara Rodgers on sound; Shintaro Miyazaki on algorhythmics; Matthew Fuller on software\nstudies; Nina Belojevic and Shaun Macpherson on physical computing; Steven E. Jones on\nthe eversion; Anna Munster on networks; Mark Williams on television; Gregory Zinman on\nmoving images; Virginia Kuhn on analytics; Paul Benzon on media archaeology; and Shannon\n\n \n\nMattern. on infrastructures.\n\nPart IV. Remediation, Data, Memory: In the humanities, how is media preserved?\nWhat role does it play in memory? When does it become “data”? And how does it change\nacross formats over time? Moving between old and new media, the past and present, this\nsection of the Companion addresses these questions and more. In the process, it builds on\nJay David Bolter and Richard Grusin’s foundational text, Remediation (1998). This part features\nKathleen Fitzpatrick on obsolescence and innovation; Jon Bath, Alyssa Arbuckle, Constance\nCrompton, Alex Christie, Ray Siemens, and the INKE Research Group on futures of the\nbook; Howard Rambsy II on collaborative annotation; Dene Grigar and Stuart Moulthrop\non preserving born-digital texts; Timothy Murray on curating and preserving new media art;\nVictoria Szabo on apprehension through augmented reality; Bryan Carter on teaching Digital\nAfricana Studies; Angel David Nieves on 3-D histories of South Aftica; Kimberly Christen\non Indigenous systems of knowledge and archival practices; Eric Hoyt, Tony Tran, Derek\nLong, Kit Hughes, and Kevin Ponto on applying scaled entity search to media history; Jeffrey\n\n \n\nSchnapp on the art of description; and Lauren F. Klein on data visualization and memory.\nPart V. Making, Programming, Hacking: Practices such as making, programming,\nand hacking intertwine in many ways with writing, ethnography, and even archival work.\nUnderscoring the critical and creative dimensions of these practices, this section surveys\nnoninstrumentalist approaches to code, platforms, and machines that privilege inquiry over\nproof. This part features Annette Vee on programming and literacy; Noah Wardrip-Fruin\non expressive processing; Anastasia Salter on building interactive stories; Mark C. Marino\ncal code studies; Jacob Gaboury on critical unmaking and queer computation; Kat\nJungnickel on learning from doing; Jennifer Gabrys on citizen sensing; and Daniela K. Rosner\n\n \n\n   \n\non design as inquiry.\n\nUltimately, the methods and methodologies presented here do not cohere into an\nexhaustive or totalizing entanglement of media studies with digital humanities. The differences\nbetween them are telling and meaningful, and—encouraged by the HASTAC community,\nincluding the affirmative work of Fiona Barnett and Cathy Davidson (see Davidson 2011)—\nit is in the spirit of difference that I invite readers to study media through new media.

MLA 2011 unleashed another round of debates,\nas Pannapacker pointed to a DH in-crowd, an ironic label for a group of people who\nhave long felt like misfits (Pannapacker, “Digital Humanities Triumphant?”).\nAlthough the debate has generated intellectual energy and compelling\nexchanges, it also has left me frustrated by statements that seem to devalue the work\nof fellow digital humanists and longing for a more coherent sense of community.\nEven as we debate the digital humanities, We need to participate in a frank discus-\nsion about what connects us and what values we hold in common. Given that the\ndigital humanities community includes people with different disciplines, method-\nological approaches, professional roles, and theoretical inclinations, it is doubtful\nthat we will settle on a tight definition of the digital humanities—just witness the\nmany definitions of the term offered by participants in the Day of Digital Humani-\nties (“How do you define Humanities Computing/Digital Humanities?”). Instead\nof trying to pigeonhole digital humanities by prescribing particular methods or\ntheoretical approaches, we can instead focus on a community that comes together\naround values such as openness and collaboration.

How the digital humanities community operates—\ntransparently, collaboratively, through online networks—distinguishes it. Even as\nwe acknowledge points of difference, | propose that the digital humanities commu-\nnity develop a flexible statement of values that it can use to communicate its identity\nto itself and the general public, guide its priorities, and perhaps heal its divisions.\nRather than debating who is in and who is out, the DH community needs to develop\na keener sense of what it stands for and what is at stake in its work. Taking an initial\nstep toward this goal, I will discuss the rationale for creating a core values statement\nby drawing on the literature about professional codes, suggest a process for engag-\ning the community in developing a values statement, explore models for and influ-\nences on DH values, and analyze the DH literature to put forward potential values.\n\nWhy the Digital Humanities Community Needs a Statement of Values\n\nBy creating a core set of values, the digital humanities community may be able to\nunite to confront challenges such as the lack of open access to information and hide-\nbound policies that limit collaboration and experimentation. As Kathleen Fitzpat-\nrick notes of the digital humanities, “the key problems that we face again and again\nare social rather than technological in nature: problems of encouraging participa-\ntion in collaborative and collective projects, of developing sound preservation and\nsustainability practices, of inciting institutional change, of promoting new ways of\nthinking about how academic work might be done in the coming years” (Fitzpatrick,\n“Reporting from the Digital Humanities 2010 Conference”). Solving such problems\nis not simple, but an important first step may be articulating shared values that can\nthen be used to define goals, develop collaborations, and foster participation. Most\nprofessional organizations advance a set of values or an ethical code to make clear\ntheir aspirations, set standards of behavior, “provide the foundation of institutional\nmission and guide professional practice and decision making” (Miller, 5). Further,\nvalues statements can enable groups to confront change while remaining true to\ntheir overarching principles (Bell).\n\nYet even as they help to define a community, values statements can also con-\nfine it, reflecting a static understanding of the organization or the particular biases\nof a powerful clique that defines the standards. Finding consensus on the few val-\nues held in common by the community is difficult (Weissinger); indeed, dissensus\nplays an important role in pressing an organization to consider blind spots and\nalternative perspectives. Thus organizations must seek community-wide input on\nvalues statements and view them as flexible and contextual rather than fixed and\neternal. As I suggest later in the section “How to Produce a Values Statement,” the\nDH community should reflect its own spirit of collaboration and flexibility in\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\nLay\n\f"

Whereas\nvalues “represent closely held. belief[s] and ideal(s],” ethics “are stated guidelines\nattempting to describe standards and inform behavior so that the behavior will\nmeet these standards” (Miller, 8). A statement of values is typically broader than\nan ethical code and serves in part to inspire and to help an organization set pri-\norities, defining what it holds most important. Professional codes such as ethical\nguidelines or values statements fulfill several functions, including providing guid-\nance for professionals, shaping the public’s expectations of the profession, promot-\ning professional socialization, improving the profession's reputation, “preserv|ing]\nentrenched professional biases,” preventing unethical actions, supporting profes-\nsionals in their decision making, and adjudicating disputes (Frankel, 111~12). While\n\n \n\na statement of values won't settle debates in the digital humanities (nor should it),\nit will at least frame them and provide the grounds for conversation. The digital\nhumanities profession, loosely configured as it is, has matured to the point where it\nneeds a values statement to help articulate its mission.\n\nHOW TO PRODUCE A VALUES STATEMENT\n\nProducing a values statement is difficult, since it requires you. to synthesize what\nmatters to a community even as you recognize areas of potential disagreement. (As\na good humanist, I am well aware of the contingencies, ideologies, and contexts that\nshape values.) I believe that articulating a set of values for a community should be\ndone by the community. The process of producing a values statement may be as\nimportant as the statement itself, since that process will embody how the commu-\nnity operates and what it embraces. Thus the values statement should not come\ndown on high from a Committee that meets in private, then delivers its decrees to\nthe community. Instead, the DH community should enact an open, participatory,\niterative, networked process to develop its values statement. The statement itself\nshould be created and disseminated on a wiki, so that one can see it change from\nversion to version, review the discussion history, and understand the dynamic, col-\nlaborative nature of knowledge creation. The community should engage in diverse\nefforts to solicit input and foster conversation, such as online forums, face-to-face\ndiscussions at digital humanities conferences and unconferences, and blog posts\nexploring key values. To ensure that the code of values is not narrowly focused but\nreflects the needs of the larger community, wide input should be solicited from out-\nsiders as well as “insiders” (Frankel). But someone needs to kick off the discussion,\nwhich is what I aim to do in this essay.\n\nIn defining core values, the community needs to consider what it is excluding\nas well as the cultural and ideological contexts surrounding the values it promotes.\nGiven the diversity of the community and the ways in which culture informs values,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "“This Is Why We Fight”\n\nit may be difficult to arrive at consensus on the core values (Koehler). Indeed, it is\nlikely that creating a set of core values will stimulate further debate, since different\nsubcommunities and even individuals will have their own views about what values\nare most important and whether it even makes sense to come up with a core values\nstatement. Stated values can come into conflict with the “values in practice” of com-\nmunity members (Morgan, Mason, and Nahon, 8). For example, the Wikipedia com-\nmunity split over a debate whether to include a controversial cartoon representing the\nprophet Muhammad in a Wikipedia article about the publication of that cartoon bya\nDanish newspaper, as the value of freedom of information clashed with that of “mul-\nticultural inclusivity” (Morgan, Mason, and Nahon, 9). But if the process of develop-\ning values is handled fairly and openly, conflicts can be defused and healthy discussion\ncan move the community forward. The process of developing a set of values for the\nDH community can prompt self-reflection and conversation, helping the profession\nto mature. These values should serve as beacons illuminating different paths rather\nthan rigid rules constraining choices. Even as the community recognizes that values\nare contextual rather than fixed, the process of developing a values statement can\nspark a concrete discussion about what the digital humanities is trying to achieve and\ncan produce a living document that can help guide planning and decision making.\n\nTOWARD A SET OF DIGITAL HUMANITIES VALUES\n\nIn developing a set of values, the digital humanities community can draw from sev-\neral sources that reflect its own diverse influences. The values of the digital humani-\nties represent a convergence of several sets of values, including those of the humani-\nties; libraries, museums, and cultural heritage organizations; and networked culture.\nIn some ways, these values can come into conflict, which may be contributing to the\nongoing debates about the digital humanities. Yet at their core, they share a common\naim to advance knowledge, foster innovation, and serve the public.\n\nThe values of the humanities provide the foundation for the digital humani-\nties. Indeed, the humanities are typically defined. by their focus on aesthetics and\nvalues (American Council of Learned Societies). Among core humanistic values are\ninquiry, critical thinking, debate, pluralism, balancing innovation and tradition, and\nexploration and critique (Levine et al.). Yet contemporary humanities scholarship\nalso recognizes that values are not universal or fixed but rather reflect particular\ncontexts and ideologies: “At its best, contemporary humanistic thinking does not\npeddle ideology, but rather attempts to sensitize us to the presence of ideology in\nour work, and to its capacity to delude us into promoting as universal values that\nin fact belong to one nation, one social class, one sect” (Levine et al.). We cannot\nassume that the values of one culture are shared by another culture; rather, values\nreveal the ideologies and interests of those who hold them.\n\nThe professional values of academic humanities scholars are to some extent\nnarrower than general humanistic values, as manifested in the insistence on solo\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[19\n\f"

For example, defending the\nhumanities against conservative attacks on academic specialization and literary\ntheory such as Lynne Cheney’s Humanities in America, the American Council of\nLearned Societies (ACLS) report Speaking for the Humanities insists on the impor-\ntance of professionalization: “It is precisely because teachers of the humanities take\ntheir subject seriously that they become specialists, allow themselves to be profes-\nsionals rather than amateurs—belle lettrists who unselfconsciously sustain tradi-\ntional hierarchies, traditional social and cultural exclusions, assuming that their\naudience is both universal and homogeneous” (Levine et al.). Driven by a conser-\nvative political agenda, Humanities in America takes a limited view in insisting that\nhumanities scholarship should focus solely on “timeless... truth—and. beauty and\nexcellence” (Cheney, 7). Further, it is important to defend expert knowledge and the\nacademic profession. However, the emphasis, in Speaking for the Humanities, on\nprofessionalization reinforces hierarchy and reveals its own elitism in its assumption\nthat nonprofessionals will naively uphold “traditional hierarchies.” Likewise, Speak-\ning for the Humanities celebrates the challenge to authority and objective knowil-\nedge represented by contemporary theory but insists on the authority of the pro-\nfessoriate, proclaiming that the “competence of the best scholars in the humanities\ntoday is remarkable” (Levine et al.). In a sense, these values focus more on asserting\nthe importance of scholarly authority and professional identity than on how schol-\nars work and what they do for society.\n\nSuch emphasis on specialization and professional authority clashes with the\ncollaborative, crowdsourced approaches of the digital humanities—though the dig-\nital humanities, too, wrestles with questions of how to value expert knowledge. As Ed\nAyers suggests, IT culture and academic culture often clash, as IT is “highly unsta-\nble .. . designed to be transparent,” and has “all work performed by anonymous\nteams,’ while the academy is “the most stable institution across the world ... opaque\nand. labyrinth, and “centered on scholarly stars” (Ayers, “The Academic Culture\nand the IT Culture”). The digital humanities represents a partial blending of these\ntwo cultures. Perhaps because the digital humanities includes people representing\ndifferent professional positions (faculty, librarians, technologists, museum profes-\nsionals, passionate amateurs, and others) and often deliberately pursues a public\nrole for scholarship (whether through creating freely accessible digital archives or\nsupporting networked discussion of ideas), it often better serves values such as plu-\nralism and innovation than do the professional values of the traditional academic\nhumanities, which often seem to be crouched in a defensive posture.\n\nYet the formal values statements of professional humanities organizations do\noffer important principles that can guide the digital humanities, including inquiry,\nrespect, debate, and integrity. As befits a scholarly organization, the American His-\ntorical Association’s (AHA) “Statement on Standards of Professional Conduct” does\nnot simply list particular scholarly values but rather explores and contextualizes\nthem in an essay. The document emphasizes the importance of “critical dialogue”\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

AHA’s values statement seeks a balance between\ncritical dialogue and integrity, recognizing the importance of staking out a position\nyet also of honoring evidence. Likewise, the Modern Language Association’s code\nof professional ethics emphasizes freedom of inquiry, while admitting that it can\ncome into conflict with other values. Thus the MLA acknowledges that “this free-\ndom carries with it the responsibilities of professional conduct,” including integrity,\nrespect for diversity, and fairness (Modern Language Association, “MLA Statement\nof Professional Ethics”).\n\nSince the digital humanities encompasses fields such as librarianship in addi-\ntion to humanities disciplines, we should also look to models such as the American\nLibrary Association’s (ALA) “Core Values of Librarianship.” Adopted in 2004, this\nlist of eleven values emphasizes the civic role that libraries play in promoting access,\nconfidentiality/privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intel-\nlectual freedom, preservation, the public good, professionalism, service, and social\nresponsibility (American Library Association). Whereas the values statements of\nthe academic organizations emphasize what scholars do (pursue inquiry) and how\nthey do it (with integrity), the ALA focuses on providing service and upholding\nthe public good through access, lifelong learning, and intellectual freedom. Bridg-\ning these two communities, the digital humanities community brings together core\nscholarly values such as critical dialogue and free inquiry with an ethic focused on\nthe democratic sharing of ideas.\n\nIn a sense, the digital humanities reconfigures the humanities for the Inter-\nnet age, leveraging networked technologies to exchange ideas, create communities\nof practice, and build knowledge. The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 deliber-\nately sets the digital humanities in the context of traditional humanistic values,\narguing that DH seeks to revitalize them in a time when culture is shifting from\nprint to digital forms of knowledge dissemination: “Knowledge of the Humanities\nas constituted in the modern university has shaped lives, conveyed critical skills,\nprovided a moral compass for human experiences, given pleasure and satisfaction,\ninspired acts of generosity and heroism. Digital Humanities represent an effort not\nto downplay or ‘downsize’ these traditional merits but, on the contrary, to reassert\nand reinterpret their value in an era when our relation to information, knowledge,\nand. cultural heritage is radically changing, when our entire cultural legacy as a spe-\ncies is migrating to digital formats” (UCLA Mellon Seminar in Digital Humanities).\nEven as the humanities continue to make a vital contribution to society, they must\n\n»\n\nbe “reassert/ed] and reinterpret[ed]” in a networked age.

For the digital humanities, information is not a commodity to\nbe controlled but a social good to be shared and reused.\n\nInternet values themselves grow out of the humanistic mission to explore and\n\n«\n\nexchange ideas. As Tim O'Reilly argues, “Just as the Copernican revolution was\npart of a broader social revolution that turned society away from hierarchy and\nreceived knowledge, and instead sparked a spirit of inquiry and knowledge sharing,\nopen source is part of a communications revolution designed to maximize the free\nsharing of ideas expressed in code” (O’Reilly). With the development of the Inter-\nnet and of open-source technologies come new ways to communicate information\nand ideas, build communities, and promote the growth of knowledge. The digital\n\nhumanities, dubbed “Humanities 2.0” by Cathy Davidson, likewise promote open-\n\n \n\nness, participation, and community (Davidson).\n\nIndeed, Internet values, as manifested in the ethos of open source, infuse the\ndigital humanities. As Tom Scheinfeldt argues, the digital humanities community\noperates much like a “social network,” nimble and connected: “Digital humanities\ntakes more than tools from the Internet. It works like the Internet. It takes its val-\nues from the Internet” (Scheinfeldt, “Stuff Digital Humanists Like”). Like the Inter-\nnet, the digital humanities community is distributed rather than centralized, built\non trust and the freedom to invent. Yet we might also say that, like the Internet,\nthe digital humanities community needs protocols—values—to guide its develop-\nment. As Scheinfeldt suggests, we can see these Internet values reflected in the DH\ncommunity’s focus on openness, iterative development, and transparency, as well\nas in its adoption of open-source approaches to code development and commu-\nnity education.\n\nIn some ways, the values of print culture (which is identified with the tradi-\ntional humanities) clash with those of Internet culture. As Kathleen Fitzpatrick,\nciting Lawrence Lessig, explains, “the networks of electronic communication carry\nembedded values within the codes that structure their operation, and many of the\nInternet’s codes, and thus its values, are substantively different from those within\nwhich scholars—or at least those in the humanities—profess to operate. We must\nexamine our values, and the ways that our new technologies may affect them, in\norder to make the most productive use of those new forms” (Planned Obsolescence).\nAccording to Fitzpatrick, the values of print authorship are typically “individual-\nity, originality, completeness, ownership,” while the values of the Internet include\n“open, shared protocols and codes” (Planned Obsolescence). At their core, both sets\nof values aim to promote the exchange of ideas and the progress of knowledge, but\nprint (at least in the tradition of academic prose) typically gives greater emphasis\nto authority and ownership, while digital scholarship values access, conversation,\nfluidity, and collaboration.

Whereas\nthe traditional humanities are text based and nontechnical and value solitary, spe-\nclalized work resulting in a book, the digital humanities are collaborative and tech-\nnical, value design, and are built upon shared information resources (“Digital Schol-\narship in the University Tenure and Promotion Process”).\n\nGrounded in humanistic values but catalyzed by Internet values, the digital\nhumanities seeks to push the humanities into new territory by promoting collabo-\nration, openness, and experimentation. Although no professional organization in\nthe digital humanities has, to my knowledge, crafted a values statement, we can find\nsources for such a statement in ongoing discussions in blogs and articles, the mission\nstatements of DH centers, and digital humanities manifestos. Taking a witty, prag-\nmatic look at “Stuff Digital Humanists Like,” Tom Scheinfeldt points to open social\nnetworks (Twitter vs. Facebook), agile development (rapid, iterative), do-it-yourself\n(building, making), PHP (simplicity, accessibility), and extramural grants (inno-\nvation, collaboration) (“Stuff Digital Humanists Like”). Scheinfeldt’s list captures\nmutch of what animates the digital humanities community, expressing this descrip-\ntion in terms of core technologies and technical approaches. In Diane Zorich’s\nstudy of digital humanities centers, she distills key values as expressed in their mis-\nsion statements, including “the enduring value of the humanities, collaboration\nand. cross-disciplinarity, openness, civic and social responsibility, and questioning\nsacred cows” (Zorich). Even as the digital humanities insist on the importance of\nthe humanities, they also seek to transform practices (or “sacred cows”) such as ten-\nure, publication, and peer review and to promote collaboration, cross-disciplinarity,\nand. public responsibility. The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0 advances values\nsuch as openness (open access, open source), collaboration, multiplicity, participa-\ntion, “scholarly innovation, disciplinary cross-fertilization, and the democratization\nof knowledge” (UCLA Mellon Seminar in Digital Humanities). Likewise, the Paris\n“Manifesto for the Digital Humanities” focuses on defining the DH community as\n“solidary, open, welcoming and freely accessible .. . multilingual and multidisci-\nplinary,” and favoring “the advancement of knowledge, the improvement of research\nquality in our disciplines, the enrichment of knowledge and of collective patri-\nmony, in the academic sphere and beyond it” (“Manifesto for the Digital Humani-\nties”). Running throughout these statements is an overarching sense that the digital\nhumanities should promote traditional humanistic values such as access to knowl-\nedge and civic responsibility by embracing collaboration, cross-disciplinarity, inno-\nvation, participation, and openness.\n\nPROPOSED VALUES\n\nDrawing from manifestos, model statements of value, and my own analysis of the\nrhetoric of the digital humanities, I propose the following initial list of digital human-\nities values.

Although I wanted\nto keep the list of values concise, I recognize that others should probably be added,\nsuch as sharing public knowledge, curiosity, multidisciplinarity, and balancing the-\nory and practice. With each value, I explain what it is and why it is embraced by\nthe digital humanities community, and | also offer a few examples of how the value\nmanifests itself, aggregating ongoing discussions in the digital humanities. This set\nof values signifies what the digital humanities community aspires to achieve, not\nnecessarily what it has fully met.\n\nOpenness\n\nOpenness operates on several levels in the digital humanities, describing a com-\nmitment to the open exchange of ideas, the development of open content and soft-\nware, and transparency (Zorich, 11). The digital humanities community embraces\nopenness because of both self-interest and ethical aspirations. In order to create\ndigital scholarship, researchers typically need access to data, tools, and dissemi-\nnation platforms. As Christine Borgman argues, “Openness matters for the digi-\ntal humanities for reasons of interoperability, discovery, usability, and reusability”\n(Borgman), since it means that scholars are better able to find and use the data they\nneed and create systems that work together. As participants ata 2011 MLA panel on\n“The Open Professoriate” argued, openness allows scholars to reach larger audiences\nthan the few who read academic journals, meet their responsibilities to be “pub-\nlic servants,” participate in public exchanges, and become more visible (Jaschik).\nUltimately, openness promotes the larger goal of the humanities “to democratize\nknowledge to reach out to ‘publics; share academic discoveries, and invite an array\nof audiences to participate in knowledge production” (Draxler et al.).\n\nWe can see openness at work throughout the digital humanities community,\nsuch as in open-source software tools, freely accessible digital collections, and open-\naccess journals and books. In the United States, the National Endowment for the\nHumanities (NEH) “strongly encourages” grant applicants to release software devel-\noped through NEH support as open source (National Endowment for the Humani-\nties). The digital humanities community has produced a number of open-source\ntools, including Zotero and NINES Collex. Likewise, some digital collections impor-\ntant to the digital humanities, such as the Rossetti Archive, use Creative Commons\nlicenses; even more make their content freely accessible without explicitly using such\nopen licenses. In launching Digital Humanities Quarterly, the editors decided to\nmake it open access to expand the audience and connect with fields related to the\ndigital humanities, so that “it can offer a freely accessible view of the field to those\nwho are curious about it, and can also provide a publication venue that is visible\nto readers (and potential authors) from these other domains” (Flanders, Piez, and\nTerras). Openness thus supports related values such as transdisciplinarity, collabo-\nration, and the democratization of knowledge.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

As Ethan Watrall argues, open courseware benefits the global commu-\nnity of learners by making knowledge widely available (and is thus “the right thing\nto do”), the university by making visible its curriculum and offering educational\nresources for current students, and faculty members by documenting their educa-\ntional innovations and giving them access to the pedagogical contributions of their\ncolleagues. As part of his commitment to openness and transparency, Mark Sample\nmakes his course evaluations public and shares his Zotero library (“Transparency,\nTeaching, and Taking My Evaluations Public”). As Sample argues, the work of the\nhumanities “is so crucial that we need to share what we learn, every step along the\nway” (“On Hacking and Unpacking My (Zotero) Library”). Rather than cheapen-\ning knowledge by making it free, embracing openness recognizes the importance\nof the humanities to society.\n\nCollaboration\n\nAs Steven Johnson argues, a “majority of breakthrough ideas emerge in collaborative\nenvironments” as the free flow of information allows people to build on ideas and\nthink in new ways. If reforming education and solving social problems depends on\ntapping our “collective creative potential,” then the humanities faces a “real ethical\ndilemma in its persistant [sic] presumption that intellectual work is fundamentally\nindividual,” argues Alex Reid. Thus one of the key contributions that the digital\nhumanities can make is “to encourage a new kind of communal behavior, guided\nby a new ethos”(Reid).\n\nIndeed, the digital humanities community promotes an ethos that embraces\ncollaboration as essential to its work and mission (even as it recognizes that some\nwork is better done in solitude). In part, that emphasis on collaboration reflects the\nneed for people with a range of skills to contribute to digital scholarship. As Mar-\ntha Nell Smith explains, “By its very nature, humanities computing demands new\nmodels of work, specifically those that exploit the technology of collaboration, for\nhumanities computing projects cannot be realized without project managers, text\nencoders, scanners, visionaries, and others with a variety of responsibilities to pro-\nduce effective multimedia projects.” Often collaborations in the digital humanities\nare interdisciplinary, linking together the humanistic and computational approaches\n(Siemens, Unsworth, and Schreibman). Yet collaboration isn’t just about being more\nproductive but also about transforming how the humanities work. Instead of work-\ning on a project alone, a digital humanist will typically participate as part of a team,\nlearning from others and contributing to an ongoing dialogue. By bringing together\npeople with diverse expertise, collaboration opens up new approaches to tackling a\nproblem, as statistical computing is applied to the study of literature or geospatial\ntools are used to understand historical data.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[25\n\f"

For instance, at the Digital Humanities\n2010 Conference, a number of papers, posters, and workshop sessions addressed\ncollaboration, whether as a key component of the humanities cyberinfrastructure\n(e.g, “Content, Compliance, Collaboration and Complexity: Creating and Sustain-\ning Information’), a goal for online environments (e.g., “Developing a Collabora-\ntive Online Environment for History—-The Experience of British History Online”),\na characteristic of the digital humanities community (e.g., “A Tale of Two Cities:\nImplications of the Similarities and Differences in Collaborative Approaches within\nthe Digital Libraries and Digital Humanities Communities”), or a means of accom-\nplishing work (¢.g., “An Inter-Disciplinary Approach to Web Programming: A Col-\nlaboration Between the University Archives and the Department of Computer Sci-\nence”) (Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations, Digital Humanities 2010\nConference Abstracts). In my own preliminary analysis of collaboration in the digi-\ntal humanities community, | found that, between 2004 and 2008, 48 percent of the\narticles published in Literary and Linguistic Computing, a major DH journal, were\ncoauthored, a much higher percentage than is typical of humanities journals (Spiro).\nDigital humanities centers (such as the Collaboratory for Research in Computing\nfor Humanities) strive to support collaborations (Zorich), as do digital humanities\nnetworks such as the Humanities Arts, Sciences, and Technology Advanced Col-\nlaboratory (HASTAC), a focus sometimes reflected in their names. Many digital\nhumanities funding programs explicitly require or encourage collaboration, includ-\ning the NEH’s Collaborative Research Grants, Digging into Data Challenge, JISC/\nNEH Transatlantic Digitization Collaboration Grants, and DFG/NEH joint grants.\nBut it isn’t just that the digital humanities community values collaboration—\nrather, it values collaboration that acknowledges contributions by all involved,\nwhether they are tenured. faculty, graduate students, technologists, or librarians\n(Nowviskie).

Tom Scheinfeldt calls this the “niceness” of digital humanities,\nwhich he ascribes to both its collaborative nature and its focus on method rather\nthan theory (“Why Digital Humanities is “Nice’”).

It’s the ethos that says texts and tools\nshould be available for all and that publicly funded research and instruction should\nbe publicly accessible” (Mullen). If the underlying goal is the promotion of public\nknowledge, why not share?\n\nWe can see this commitment to collegiality in both virtual and physical spaces\nthat bring together digital humanists. For example, Digital Humanities Questions\nand Answers' aims to “create a friendly and inviting space where people can help\neach other with questions about languages, tools, standards, best practices, peda-\ngogy, and all things related to scholarly activity in the digital humanities (broadly\ndefined)” (Meloni). Between September of 2010 and April 2011, Digital Human-\nities Questions and Answers has attracted over one thousand posts, attesting to\nthe willingness of the DH community to help. Likewise, THATCamp, an “uncon-\nference” that promotes collaboration and conversation in the digital humanities,\naims to be “open, . . . informal,” and “non-hierarchical and. non-disciplinary and\ninter-professional” (French). Rather than establishing an agenda in advance, THAT-\nCamps encourage participants to write short blog posts before the unconference to\ndescribe their session ideas, then charge the participants with defining the sched-\nule during the first session. At a typical THATCamp, it doesn’t matter whether you\nare a senior faculty member, a graduate student, a programmer, or an early career\nlibrarian; what matters is your willingness to participate and the quality of your\nideas. With the participants in charge of defining the conference, sometimes indi-\nviduals can dominate the discussion, and some conversations can be less inclusive\nthan others, but the ethic of THATCamp emphasizes collaboration, productivity,\nand fun (French).\n\nRecently, this idea of inclusiveness in the digital humanities has come under\ncritique. For example, William Pannapacker noted the split between “builders\nand theorizers” and “an in-group, out-group dynamic” in the digital humanities\n(“Digital Humanities Triumphant?”), a comment echoed by others (Sulley). But\nas Stéfan Sinclair suggests, the digital humanities community recognizes a vari-\nety of contributions, from authoring publications to moderating discussion lists\nto developing software. Many of its members devote themselves to serving the\ncommunity—“advocating for the digital humanities at various levels, helping to\nprovide support and expertise for other colleagues, mentoring junior colleagues\nformally and informally” (Sinclair). Still, leaders of the digital humanities com-\nmunity have reacted. with concern to the charge of exclusiveness. Geoffrey Rock-\nwell argues for providing more paths to entry to the community, looks to THAT-\nCamp as a model for “creating a new ‘we of community,” and concludes, “May\nwe have the grace to welcome the exuberance of passion of the next generation.”\nLikewise, John Unsworth suggests that “to expand the community further,” digi-\ntal humanities will need to demonstrate how it can advance humanities research,\nprovide support for researchers and teachers who want to use digital tools and\nmethods, and reward their efforts (“The State of Digital Humanities, 2010”).

There’s a disposition that the battles of race, gender, class\nand ecology have already been won, their lessons have been learned, and by espous-\ning a rhetoric of equity everything will fall into place” (Higgin). Similarly, Anne\nCong-Huyen asks, “where are those individuals and communities who are visibly\ndifferent to examine and create or represent disparate voices and media objects?”\n\nGiven the DH community’s orientation toward building and making rather\n\nthan theorizing, its focus has not really been on cultural politics, although Alan Liu\nand others have been pressing it to engage with cultural criticism (Liu). Based on my\nadmittedly anecdotal observations at DH gatherings, the community may not have\nachieved the same degree of diversity in race and ethnicity as it has in professional\nroles, nationalities, age, disciplines, and gender. However, the community works\ntoward diversity as a goal. In recognition of the need for the digital humanities to be\ndiverse, THATCamp SoCal created a position statement, “Towards an Open Digital\n\na «\n\nHumanities”: “Digital humanities must take active strides to include all the areas of\nstudy that comprise the humanities and must strive to include participants of diverse\n\nage, generation, skill, race, ethnicity, sexuality, ability, nationality, culture, discipline,\n\n \n\nareas of interest. Without open participation and broad outreach, the digital human-\nities movement limits its capacity for critical engagement” (Rivera Monclova). The\ncommunity's desire to achieve diversity and inclusiveness is reflected in the theme\nof the 2011 Digital Humanities conference, “Big Tent Digital Humanities” (Alliance\nof Digital Humanities Organizations, “General CFP”). The call for papers for the\nconference includes “digital humanities and diversity” as a suggested topic, reflecting\nboth the importance given to the topic and the sense that it merits deeper discussion.\n\nExperimentation\n\nThe language of experimentation runs throughout the digital humanities, demon-\nstrating its support of risk taking, entrepreneurship, and innovation. By leveraging\ninformation technology to explore data, digital humanities casts intellectual prob-\nlems as experiments: What is the effect of modeling the data in a particular way?\nWhat happens when we visualize data or use text mining tools to discover patterns\nin it? (Svensson, “The Landscape of Digital Humanities”). As Willard McCarty sug-\ngests, “ours is an experimental practice, using equipment and instantiating definite\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

The word “experiment” turns up in Burrows’s Computation into\nCriticism: A Study of Jane Austen’s Novels and an Experiment in Method, which\nexplores the use of textual analysis software to study Austen’s language. Likewise,\nAyers and Thomas initially included the word “experiment” Two American Com-\nmunities on the Eve of the Civil War: An Experiment in Form and Analysis (Ayers\nand Thomas)—in the title of their article for The American Histerical Review,\nwhich tests how historians can “create or present new forms of scholarship and\nnarrative” (Thomas, 415). However, reviewers rejected the article’s use of hypertext,\nsince it “frustrated readers’ expectations for a scholarly article laid out in a certain\nway” (Ayers, “The Academic Culture and the IT Culture”). When Ayers and Thom-\nas’s article was finally published in the journal, it adopted a “much-simplified form”\nand took a new title that deemphasized its experimental approach: “The Differences\nSlavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities” (Ayers, “The Aca-\ndemic Culture and the IT Culture”). Perhaps a traditional academic journal wasr’t\nready for “an experiment in form and analysis” (although the language of experi-\nmentation still permeates the article).\n\nNot all experiments succeed as originally imagined, but the digital humani-\nties community recognizes the value of failure in the pursuit of innovation. “(T]o\nencourage innovations in the digital humanities,” the National Endowment for the\nHumanities offers “Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants,” which “are modeled, in\npart, on the ‘high risk/high reward’ paradigm often used by funding agencies in the\nsciences” (National Endowment for the Humanities). Failure is accepted as a use-\nful result in the digital humanities, since it indicates that the experiment was likely\nhigh risk and means that we collectively learn from failure rather than reproducing\nit (assuming that the failure is documented). As John Unsworth argues, “If an elec-\ntronic scholarly project car’t fail and doesn’t produce new ignorance, then it isr’t\nworth a damn” (“Documenting the Reinvention of Text”).\n\nMany digital humanities organizations model themselves after laboratories,\nemphasizing the experimental, collaborative nature of their work. In defining the\nterm “digital humanities center,” Diane Zorich characterizes it as “an entity where\nnew media and technologies are used for humanities-based research, teaching, and\nintellectual engagement and experimentation” (4). Indeed, a number of DH centers\nposition themselves as labs, including the University of Virginia’s Scholars’ Lab, the\nHUMiab at Umea University, and University of California Davis's Humanities Inno-\nvation Lab, reflecting the sense of a lab both as a space where experiments are car-\nried out and as a community focused on exploration and experimentation. Likewise,\nthe Stanford Literary Lab focuses on quantitative methods to study literature, where\n“lildeally, research will take the form of a genuine ‘experiment’” (“Stanford. Liter-\nary Lab”).

Dan\nCohen ran an experiment to see if he could disseminate a historical puzzle via Twit-\nter and get an answer back from the research community (Cohen). Similarly, in\nlaunching Digital Humanities Quarterly, the editors characterize it as an experi-\nment “in how academic journals are published, given its use of open standards\nsuch as XML and commitment to “the rhetoric of digital authoring” (Flanders,\nPiez, and Terras). Experimentation goes on in the classroom as well as in research\nand publishing. For instance, the Looking for Whitman project brought together\nclasses at four different universities to explore the work of Walt Whitman, collabo-\nrate using social networking technologies, and contribute to an open repository of\nresources from places where Whitman once lived (“About Looking for Whitman”).\nJim Groom characterizes Looking for Whitman as “an atterapt to experiment with\nhow [a group] of distributed faculty and students can share, collaborate, and con-\nverse out in the open” (Groom). “Experiment” thus suggests the aim to develop\ninnovative, novel practices for humanities research and teaching.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo some extent, some digital humanities values may clash with the norms of the\nacademy. For example, universities intellectual property policies may be unfavor-\nable toward producing open-source software. In addition, professors may find it\ndifficult to find publishers for their work if they initially release it as open access\n(although some publishers—including the University of Minnesota Press, which\nis publishing this volume—are willing to adopt open licenses). Likewise, many\nhumanities departments favor solo work in their tenure and promotion policies\nand. may find it difficult to determine how to assign credit for collaborative work\n(Modern Language Association, Report of the MLA Task Force on Evaluating Schol-\narship for Tenure and Promotion). This resistance (or, in some cases, ignorance)\nmakes it all the more important for the DH community to come together in putting\nforward values such as openness and collaboration. These values point to an over-\narching ethos that promotes innovative scholarship as a public good and believes\nthat it should be practiced openly and collaboratively.\n\nBy developing a core values statement, the digital humanities community can\ncraft a more coherent identity, use these values as guiding principles, and pass them\non as part of DH education. What defines a profession is not only what it does\nbut also what values it upholds and how it practices “professional responsibility”\n(Fuller and Keim). If groups share common values, they are typically governed more\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:13 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

As Patrick Svensson notes, the DH community offers “rather strong sup-\nport for expanding the territory and for achieving a higher degree of penetration”\nacross the humanities community (“Humanities Computing as Digital Humani-\nties”); one way to reach out is to articulate core values that those both inside and out-\nside the community might understand and embrace. Of course, these values must\noperate in a specific context, where they may clash or get complicated. But they can\nhelp to guide decision making about priorities and serve as the basis for the DH\ncommunity's goals. Should projects use proprietary code? What should DH curri-\ncula emphasize? What should determine the agenda of a DH center or professional\norganization? In tackling these questions, we can draw guidance from an explicit\nyet evolving set of community values.\n\nNOTES\n\nThis essay elaborates ideas that | first articulated in “What Is She Doing Here?

It is a well-chosen conference topic given\n\nWise\n\nYy\n\n«un the current, often fairly intense debate about the scope and direction of\n\n \n\nthe digital humanities, one also exemplified by the Modern Language Association\n(MLA) 2011 panel on “The History and Future of the Digital Humanities” as well\nas a number of concurrent online discussions. This debate has a disciplinary, his-\ntorical, and institutional basis and is backdropped by considerable interest in the\ndigital humanities from universities, funding agencies, scholars, and others. More-\nover, there is a basic tension between a tradition invested in technology as a tool\nand methodology and a range of “newcomers” starting out from other modes of\nengagement between the humanities and the digital (Svensson, “Landscape”). A\nrelated point of tension has to do with the scope of the digital humanities. Argu-\nably, much of the hope and interest currently invested in the digital humanities\nrelates to an inclusive notion of the field and a sense of the digital humanities as\na way of reconfiguring the humanities (Svensson, “Envisioning” ). Hence the issue\nof the size of the digital humanities canalizes a range of important debates and\nfuture critical choices.\n\nThis chapter explores the contemporary landscape of digital humanities start-\ning from the discourse of “big tent” digital humanities. What is it exactly that\nneeds to be incorporated into the tent that was not there before? Does a larger\ntent come with expanded responsibilities? Why do we need a tent or a bounding\nmechanism in the first place? Is there place for private as well as public institutions\nof higher education in the tent? Is a very inclusive notion of digital humanities\nproblematic? The chapter ends with a suggestion that the community may ben-\nefit from a “no tent” approach to the digital humanities and that “trading zone”\n(Galison) or “meeting place” may be useful, alternative structuring devices and\nideational notions.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "Beyond the Big Tent\n\nSizing the Digital Humanities\n\nThere can be no doubt that the digital humanities have expanded in multiple ways\nover the last ten years. Indeed, ten years ago, the notion of digital humanities itself\nwas aml emerging one, arising out of a relabeling process within the humanities\ncomputing community (Kirschenbaum; Svensson, “Humanities Computing”). The\nperceived larger size would partly seem to be a result of having a more distinct and\ninclusive label, although there has also obviously been a real expansion as indicated\nby new book series, the number of positions advertised, funding available, the grow-\ning number of digital humanities initiatives, interest from policy makers and uni-\nversity leadership, increased visibility, and general buzz.\n\nThe digital humanities arose from a specific epistemic tradition or set of\ntraditions (Knorr Cetina), and with the expansion of the field comes a higher\ndegree of heterogeneity and inclusion of other epistemic traditions (Svensson,\n“Humanities Computing”). This is part of what makes the digital humanities a\ndynamic and, to some extent, indeterminate field. It is important to note that\ntraditional humanities computing, as well as digital humanities, frequently have\nhad an intersectional position. In other words, digital humanities institutions\ntend to depend on interaction with other institutions to a larger extent than\nmost traditional departments and disciplines. This is evident in the idea of a\nmethodological commons (McCarty), for instance; and it is also notable that\nthe digital humanities have often been institutionalized as centers and institutes\nrather than as traditional departments. Indeed, such centers may be more insti-\ntutionally akin to traditional humanities centers than departments. Examples\ninclude the Centre for Computing in the Humanities (CCH) at King’s College,\nthe Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the Uni-\nversity of Virginia, and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humani-\nties (MITH) at the University of Maryland. These centers obviously share some\ncharacteristics, such as a range of activities and strategies to do work with other\nparts of the humanities, as well as outside of the humanities proper. This lim-\ninal position is quite important, offering something that can be built on in\norder to facilitate digital humanities as a larger project. However, we also need\nto acknowledge that this necessitates the reassessing of traditions and possible\ninteraction points between the humanities and the digital and allowing change\nnot only in terms of size but also in terms of epistemic texture and institutional\nfocus. An interesting question is whether the recent name change of the Cen-\ntre for Computing in the Humanities to the Department of Digital Humanities\nindicates a difference in self-conception and whether it will result in a different\ninstitutional position.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 37\n\f"

            "result": "PATRIK SVENSSON\n\nYale University: Inside or Outside the Tent?\n\nThe listed institutions all come from the humanities computing tradition. What’s\nmore, we are now seeing a range of new initiatives not anchored in this tradition\nas strongly, which sometimes leads to points of tension. A useful example is Yale\nUniversity’s relatively recent interest in digital humanities as manifested in a work-\ning group for the digital humanities started in 2009. On their website, the field is\ndescribed as follows: “Digital humanities encompass an array of convergent prac-\ntices that explore a world in which scholarship is not exclusively produced in print\nbut is created and distributed through new digital technologies. This group will con-\nsider the expanding practices, vocabulary, and research methods germane to digital\nhumanities across disciplines.” This is a fairly inclusive definition, arguably compat-\nible with a big-tent notion of the digital humanities. The discussion of Yale’s interest\nin the digital humanities is presumably inflected by the fact that Yale is not just any\nnewcomer but an Ivy League school and one arguably coming to the field from a\ndifferent tradition (as evidenced by a close connection to media theory). In Febru-\nary 2010, the conference “The Past’s Digital Presence” received considerable atten-\ntion partly through Humanist editor Willard McCarty’s description of it as a “water-\nshed moment” (McCarty, Humanist). This gracious introduction of Yale University\ninto the digital humanities was met with some resistance. In a subsequent Human-\nist post, University of Nebraska professor Amanda Gailey expressed some concern:\n\nI find that the “watershed” comment overlooks the work that many grad stu-\ndents have been doing at non-Ivy schools for several years now. ... Importantly,\nmany of us who did not attend Ivy League schools and who professionally defined\nourselves as digital humanists before it became an MLA buzzword were argu-\n\nably taking many more risks... . Frankly, I view the late arrival of the Ivies as a\n\n \n\nworrisome indicator that DH will soon be locked down by the same tired socio-\neconomic gatekeeping mechanisms that prevent many people with talent from\n\nsucceeding at so many other academic disciplines. (Gailey)\n\nGailey reacts to McCarty’s description of the workshop but also to the aspira-\ntions of Yale and other Ivy League schools to enter the digital humanities. There is a\nclear sense of pointing to the tradition of humanities computing as digital humani-\nties here and the personal and institutional investment of digital humanists with\na long-term engagement in the field. It should also be noted here that the list of\nreadings for the Yale Digital Humanities Working Group includes pieces such as\nJohn Unsworth’s 2002 paper “What Is Humanities Computing and What Is Not?”\nshowing sensibility to the history of the field. There is probably some truth to Gai-\nley’s socioeconomic concerns (which obviously are shared by others in the commu-\nnity as evident in Katherine Harris's comment (Harris), although expansion would\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Maybe a stronger interest from elite universities could even help\nleverage the digital humanities as a project and the humanities as Yale (as suggested\nby Cohen in relation to discussing the Open Content Alliance)? Also, the creation\nof a working group at Yale does not in itself necessarily represent an institution-\nally strategic move. It could be argued that the working group indicates interest\nfrom faculty, graduate students, and technology experts. Of course, such interest\ncannot be entirely removed. from institutional politics and the overall traction of\ndigital humanities. The fact that the working group has the web address digitalhu-\nmanities-yale.edu carries institutional meaning, and the heading “Digital Humani-\nties at Yale” on that web page indicates a strategic position. At the same time, the\nbreadth of the digital humanities at Yale is indicated by a subsequent conference not\norganized by the working group but advertised on the digital humanities website:\n“Yale Media Theory and History Conference” (April 22~23, 2011). Internal priori-\nties must also be considered; perhaps scholars interested in the digital humanities\nat Yale need support from the wider digital humanities (DH) community in order\nfor their initiative to take off.\n\nAn important question here concerns who is the real gatekeeper. Gailey’s reluc-\ntance to acknowledge Yale as a new addition to the field appears to be due to Yale\nbeing a privileged school that had not been part of the buildup of the field. It\ncould be argued, however, that a big-tent notion of the digital humanities must be\nbased on an open invitation and generosity rather than past hardships. At the same\ntime, we need to acknowledge that expanding territory and, in particular, epistemic\nrange is not unproblematic and that boundary making is integral to disciplinary\nformation.\n\nAnother type of reluctance is based on the type of digital humanities that Yale is\nseen as representing and its associated epistemic commitments. Many of the people\nactive in the Yale working group seem to be “traditional” scholars interested in the\ndigital more as a digitally inflected object of inquiry. In a polemic position statement\nfrom the MLA 2011 conference, Stephen Ramsay points to “coding” or “making” as\na necessary criterion to qualify for the digital humanities, and in the discussion he\nbrings in Yale (and some other schools):\n\nBut what if Duke or Yale were to offer a degree in Digital Humanities and they\nsaid “no” to code and “yes” to text? Or “no” to building and “yes” to theorizing?\nOr decided that Digital Humanities is what we used to call New Media Studies\n(which is the precise condition, as far as I can tell, at Dartmouth)? You might\nneed to know how to code in order to be competitive for relevant grants with\nthe ODH, NSF, or Mellon. Maybe that means Yale’s DH ambitions will never\nget off the ground. Or maybe Yale is powerful enough to redefine the mission\nof those institutions with respect to the Humanities. Most institutions, for the\n\nrecord, are not.

However,\nit is quite clear that this is an example of gatekeeping based on epistemic traditions\nand commitments. Funding agency structures and programs, often seen as barri-\ners in the humanities computing tradition (cf. Terras and Smithies), are used as a\ngatekeeping device.\n\nJoining Willard McCarty in approval of the Yale event was John Unsworth,\nanother established. digital humanities representative. It is notable that both\nMcCarty and Unsworth have secure institutional positions, while scholars critiqu-\ning the Yale event were less established in the field. McCarty and Unsworth represent\nthe core of the community, and their praise hence comes from deep inside the dis-\ncipline, which may help explain some of the intensity of the discussion. Unsworth\n(12-13) notes that graduate students organized the conference and lists the titles\nof PhD projects of these graduate students. These include “The Liberal Schoolmas-\nter” and “Literary Souvenirs: Didactic Materialism in Late Eighteenth- and Early\n\n \n\nNineteenth-Century Fiction.” Unsworth asks, “How did these students get drawn\ninto the digital humanities?” (13). This is a very interesting question, the answer to\nwhich demonstrates that even a big tent—enacted by Unsworth—can be coupled\nwith epistemic predispositions:\n\nFinally, back to that remark Willard made, about the graduate students in the\nYale conference—the remark generally overlooked in the dispute about water-\nsheds. What he said was that “quite independently of the work us older ones\nhave done for so long, these students see the possibilities now visible and ques-\ntion them as befits the humanities.” This is perhaps the most interesting point,\nand the one on which I will end. Coming up behind Christy and Harris, Gailey,\nRamsay, Bogost, Kirschenbaum, McCarty, Ayers, Stallybrass, and me, is a gen-\neration of graduate students who essentially learned to do research with digital\ntools; they aren’t necessarily aware of the history that’s implicit, just barely sub-\nmerged, in the exchanges we've been considering here-—they actually dort care\nail that much about the back-story. They’re interested in grabbing these tools,\nusing these new library services, and making their own mark, and they have some\ninteresting questions to ask. (Unsworth, 18)\n\nThe Yale graduate students are “read” as coming to the digital humanities through\nhaving “learned to do research with digital tools” and being interested in “grabbing\nthese tools.” While the conference program to some extent was tool and. encoding\nbased, the PhD titles previously listed by Unsworth would seem to indicate analytical\nresearch of more traditional type, and the question is whether these students really\ncame to the digital humanities (if they actually came to stay) through an interest in\ntools and library services. Again, the point here is that this is not just a question of\nthe size of the tent but also about how the tent is epistemologically textured.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "Beyond the Big Tent\n\nWhat Types of Digital Humanities?\n\nThe place of Yale University in the digital humanities tent can be partially related\nto how the relationship between the humanities and the digital is conceived. In tra-\nditional digital humanities (or humanities computing), technology or tool-related\nmethodology often serves an instrumental function (Svensson, “Humanities Com-\nputing”). I have argued elsewhere that the interrelation between the humanities and\nthe digital can be discussed in terms of different modes of engagement: the digital\nor technology as tool, study object, medium, laboratory, and activist venue (Svens-\nson, “Landscape”). If big-tent digital humanities reaches across these modes of\nengagement, the tool-oriented. approach is only one among several possible modes\nof engagements.\n\nWe can see the primary role given to tools in Unsworth’s discussion or in\nthe idea of a methodological commons as a core structural component of the\nfield. In discussing the methodological commons, McCarty writes that humanities\ncomputing has been able to transcend disciplinary and institutional boundaries\nthrough a methodological commons “for all to draw on”; and, in his thoughtful\noutlining of the commons, it is quite clear that we are concerned with a particular\nmodel (118). For instance, it is based on introducing data types and a set of tools\nto manipulate the data, and the tools in turn are derived from formal methods\n(136). There is considerable complexity to this issue, and tools can be both instru-\nmental and deeply integrated into humanistic research endeavors. This said, we\nshould be careful not to see tools as neutral artifacts. In an enlightening discus-\nsion on digital visualization tools, Johanna Drucker maintains that graphical tools\nsuch as GIS, mapping, and graphs are based on underlying assumptions, which\n“are cloaked in a rhetoric taken wholesale from the techniques of the empiri-\ncal sciences that conceals their epistemological biases under a guise” (Drucker).\nWhile tools themselves can be epistemologically predisposed, it could be argued\nthat placing tools and tool-related methodology at the base of digital humanities\nwork implies a particular view of the field and, within big-tent digital humani-\nties, possibly an exclusive stance. One central question is whether the tent can\nnaturally be taken to include critical work construing the digital as an object of\ninquiry rather than as a tool.\n\nWhen Unsworth notes that the young Yale scholars have “some interesting\nquestions to ask,” the epistemic perspective is not so much seen in asking or not\nasking analytical questions but in how one gets to the questions. If tools and related\nmechanisms underlie an epistemic commitment, this would be evident in the ques-\ntions either being asked through the tools or arising as a result of using the tools.\nOne pertinent question, then, is whether there is room for research in the digital\nhumanities that does not engage with tools, or “making” in Ramsey’s fairly narrow\nsense, and whether that work can be accepted in its own right.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[41\n\f"

In general, it is casier to be inside\nthan outside, and it would seem quite important to be inclusive and generous when\none is part of the established core of a field or discipline. Language plays a signifi-\ncant role here, and what seems uncontroversial from an internal perspective can be\nexclusionary from an outside perspective.\n\nThe DH 2011 Call for Papers: Inclusionary or Exclusionary?\n\nConferences are important in the formation of disciplines and fields (Klein),\nand the principal conference for the digital humanities is the annual conference\nnamed “Digital Humanities.” This conference series is grounded in the tradition\nof humanities computing; it goes back to at least the early 1990s and is currently\norganized by the Association for Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO). 1\nhave earlier discussed the 2009 Call for Papers for the Digital Humanities confer-\nence (Svensson, “Humanities Computing”) as clearly representing a specific tra-\ndition of digital humanities rather than a more multivalent approach. As Stéfan\nSinclair observes, the conference is quite competitive in terms of accepted pro-\nposals (34 percent in 2010), and there is a tendency to “push inwards toward the\ncentre of recognized digital humanities research and practices.” He argues that\nthe conference can thus be seen to stifle growth and innovation and also points\nto it serving several disciplines and institutional contexts. Sinclair also notes that\nnew conferences (such as Yale’s “The Past’s Digital Presence” discussed earlier)\nhave helped to decenter the Digital Humanities conference. However, there can\nbe no doubt that it is the main conference for the field (at least as traditionally\nconceived) and thus an important arena for negotiating a more inclusive notion\nof digital humanities.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this chapter, the theme for the 201] conference is\n“Big Tent Digital Humanities, a theme that makes it particularly relevant to look\nagain at the Call for Papers (CFP) for the conference:\n\nProposals might, for example, relate to the following aspects of digital humani-\nties: research issues, including data mining, information design and modelling,\nsoftware studies, and humanities research enabled through the digital medium;\ncomputer-based research and computer applications in literary, linguistic, cul-\ntural and historical studies, including electronic literature, public humanities,\nand interdisciplinary aspects of modern scholarship.

This may not\nbe surprising given the history of the conference series, but the current state of the\nfield and the theme would seem to call for a more clearly inclusive stance. Again,\nit is important to consider inside and. outside perspectives. It may be that the call\nunder discussion seems inclusive to the organizers of the conference, whereas it is\nseen as exclusionary by “outsiders” or newcomers to the field. For instance, most of\nthe aspects listed could be said to represent tool-oriented and text-based. research.\nThrough talking about “humanities research enabled through the digital medium,”\nthe technology or medium is also given considerable agency. The long-standing\nhumanities computing interest in cultural heritage work is evident through the\nfocus on creation and curation of digital resources. The only aspect listed that can\neasily be seen as reaching outside of the tradition is the one focusing on “digital\narts, architecture, music, film, theater, new media, and related areas.” This is quite\na significant inclusion, but it is worth noting that in contrast with the two preced-\ning items on the list, there is no further elaboration.

If this is how the big tent is reflected among the suggested topic areas, it\ndoes not necessarily seem inviting, nor does it speak to those communities that do\nnot share tool-oriented or text-based approaches to research.\n\nIn the introduction to the call, there is special focus on big-tent aspects: “With\nthe Big Tent theme in mind, we especially invite submissions from Latin American\nscholars, scholars in the digital arts and music, in spatial history, and in the public\nhumanities” (“General Call for Papers,” Digital Humanities 2011). It seems that this\nspecification is narrower than the topic area just discussed and, to an outsider, some-\nwhat arbitrary (although the local context at Stanford would seem to be an impor-\ntant rationale). For instance, a new media scholar interested in the digital humani-\nties may not feel inclined to submit a proposal, particularly because new media is\nnot included in the big-tent specification and is instead listed together with some\nfairly unrelated areas without further elaboration in the list of topics.\n\nWe would expect newcomers to be prepared to make an effort and learn about\nthe context of the conference and tradition. However, sometimes what may be clear\nto insiders may not be accessible to newcomers. This can be exemplified with the\nreference to the journal Literary and Linguistic Computing in the Call for Papers.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 43\n\f"

If the new media scholar\ninterested in digital humanities imagined earlier was not stopped by the text in the\nCall for Papers and followed the advice to look at the journal to find out more, it\nis very likely that he or she would not feel included or inclined to actually register\nfor the conference.\n\nHowever, the emphasis on this particular journal is partly institutional. It was\nstarted in 1973 and has been the journal of two of the core humanities comput-\ning associations, as well as for the journal of the Association for Digital Humani-\nties Organizations (AHDOQ). Furthermore, it is part of a funding mechanism for\nADHO (and its organizations), as members and member organizations pay their\nfees through subscribing to the journal. All this means that LLC has a special status\nbut not necessarily that all members of traditional digital humanities (or humanities\ncomputing) see this journal as the primary voice of the field. To an outsider, how-\never, this arrangement may not be particularly transparent. A very simple adjust-\nment would be to also include the Digital Humanities Quarterly (also supported\nby ADHO) as a reference in the Call for Papers. It has a considerably broader scope\nthan LLC and is open access. A more radical suggestion would be to also list a few\njournals outside the core tradition. This would clearly indicate a big-tent sentiment\nand pronounced interest in other traditions.\n\nBig Visions\n\nI have argued elsewhere (Svensson, “Envisioning”) that contemporary digital\nhumanities can be associated with an interest in change and that the field can be used\nas a means to imagine the future of the humanities. This is typically more appar-\nent in new initiatives than in traditional digital humanities. Hence one interesting\nquestion is how these “big” visions relate to a big-tent digital humanities grounded\nin the tradition of humanities computing.\n\nWhite papers produced to make a case for the digital humanities can act as a\nsource of material for visionary discourse. These documents are typically part of a\nprocess of lobbying for the field and establishing a digital humanities center. This\nis a particular type of text—typically aiming to convince university management\nto prioritize a certain area—but also indicative of hopes and strategies associated\nwith the field at particular sites. I have looked at three white papers from three\nAmerican universities: University of Wisconsin~Madison (UW-Madison), Univer-\nsity of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and Texas A&M. While the documents\nare site specific, so to speak, there is considerable overlap.

Moreover, there is a com-\nmon. view of the digital humanities as a considerable force and “game changer” in\nall three documents.\n\nThe UW-Madison documents describe how the digital humanities “plugs\ndirectly into the media culture lived by our students, our peers, and our wider\ncommunities” and how the field, through its “interconnected and infrastructural\ndimensions,” is the future of the humanities (“Enhancing Digital Humanities”).\nThey also point out how the digital humanities currently offers a “strategic nexus\nthrough which faculty, students, and staff can analyze and direct how this future\nmight unfold” (“Enhancing Digital Humanities”). This is an expansive vision that\ngoes beyond affecting and changing the humanities. The UCLA white paper simi-\nlarly extends beyond the humanities proper when it is argued that the field is “setting\nnew intellectual agendas and priorities for the twenty-first century” (“The Prom-\nise of Digital Humanities”). Furthermore, emergent modes of knowledge forma-\ntion and reaching new audiences for digitally inflected scholarship are emphasized.\nAgain, we get the impression of a field that intersects with the humanities pro-\nfoundly through multiple modes of engagement. The Texas A&M document pres-\nents two grand challenges for the center: “the need to investigate the relationship of\ncomputing technologies and culture, and the need to construct cyberinfrastructure\nfor the humanities and social sciences” (“Texas Center for Digital Humanities and\nNew Media”). The planned research——cultural records, systems, environments, and\ninteractions in the digital age—is said to engage with one of most significant ques-\ntions of our time: What does it mean to be human in the digital age? Presumably,\ntackling this question and the grand challenges requires a range of competencies as\nwell as a broad engagement with the digital (and nondigital).\n\nWhile we should exercise analytical caution given the genre of these documents,\nit seems clear that they attribute transformative power to the digital humanities and\nthat the field and associated challenges require multivalent competencies includ-\ning analytical work and engagement that may not necessarily involve digital tools,\ncoding, or a textual focus. This would seem to suggest the importance of a broadly\nconceived. digital humanities and the need for a larger tent than the one indicated\nby the Digital Humanities 2011 Call for Papers.\n\nThe Digital Humanities as a Trading Zone and Meeting Place\n\nIt may be difficult to recognize different epistemic traditions and support them\nwithin the framework of a digital humanities “tent” that may be stretched in some\nways (but not others). Importantly, there is a risk that a wealth of traditions and\nperspectives are subsumed and conflated in a tent primarily keyed to one particu-\nlar tradition. This is not merely a question of semantics and metaphorical systems\nbut deeply concerns how we think of the future of the field.

Such a notion\nhighlights some qualities of the digital humanities—including its commitment to\ninterdisciplinary work and deep collaboration—that could attract individuals both\ninside and outside the tent with an interest in the digital humanities. Arguably, such\nbridge building and the bringing together of epistemic traditions is not optimally\ndone from the position of discipline or department. The liminal position of the field\nis thus not seen as a problem but rather as an important quality.\n\nThe notion of trading zones comes from Peter Galison and his analysis of physi-\ncists of different paradigms carrying out collaborative research despite belonging to\ndifferent epistemic traditions. The concept can be used to describe “places” where\ninterdisciplinary work occurs and where different traditions are maintained at the\nsame time as intersectional work is carried out. We should be aware that the concept\nof “trading zone” is based on a trading and marketplace metaphor that construes\nknowledge production as trade and that comes from a scientific context.\n\nHarry Collins, Robert Evans, and Mike Gorman point to the importance of\ninteractional expertise (.e., using the language of an expert community for inter-\nacting with members) for productive engagement in cross-disciplinary work. They\nsuggest an evolution of trading zones in relation to interactional expertise, where\nthe starting point may be a cohesive situation where different groups are encour-\naged to work together, while the other end of the scale represents cultures becoming\nmore homogenous through the process of new disciplinary formation. The digi-\ntal humanities can be seen as a fractioned (not homogenous) collaborative (not\ncoerced) trading zone and a meeting place that supports deeply collaborative work,\nindividual expression, unexpected connections, and synergetic power. The “digi-\ntal,” in a broad sense and in various manifestations, functions as a shared bound-\nary object.\n\nArguably, the digital humanities needs to support and allow multiple modes of\nengagement between the humanities and the digital in order to touch at the heart\nof the disciplines, maximize points of interaction, tackle large research and meth-\nodology challenges, and facilitate deep integration between thinking and making.\nThis perspective would seem to be compatible with the digital humanities as a\ntrading zone and a meeting place. Similarly, the grand challenges identified in the\nwhite papers discussed would seem to require consorted efforts. Meeting places can\nmake such efforts possible. Whether mostly physical or mostly digital, they can help\nchannel dispersed resources, technologies, and intellectual energy. Furthermore,\ndeep integration of toolmaking and interpretative perspectives requires very dif-\nferent kinds of competencies and work to happen in the same space. It could also\nbe argued that there is value to unexpected meetings in creative environments in\nterms of expanding the digital humanities.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "Beyond the Big Tent\n\nDigital humanities as a trading zone and meeting place also emphasizes the\nintermediary and facilitating function of the digital. The digital cuts across disci-\nplines and perspectives; and, as Matt Ratto and Robert Ree observe in their study,\ndigital media is not an industrial sector in its own right. Similarly, it could be argued\nthat the digital humanities is not a discipline and that the intermediary role of the\ndigital is useful to the digital humanities in multiple ways. For instance, it allows con-\nnections to all of humanities disciplines as well as to the large parts of the academy\nand the world outside. It is no accident that there is a growing connection between\nthe public humanities and the digital humanities (“Digital Humanities at the Uni-\nversity of Washington”). Also, the digital can be used as a way of canalizing inter-\nest in rethinking the humanities and the academy. This gives a strong incitement\nfor institutions to support the digital humanities. More broadly, there is a niche to\nbe filled in most institutions of higher education—that of intersectional meeting\nplaces. The humanities is a good place for such meeting places to emerge, and the\ndigital humanities can thus unquestionably become a site for innovation, dialogue,\nand engagement with the future.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe digital humanities amply demonstrates that there is no one size that fits all. The\nheterogeneity of the field is in many ways an asset, and the current external interest\nand attraction presents a significant opportunity for expansion. At the same time,\nwe need to acknowledge that there is a core community associated with the digi-\ntal humanities and that the all-encompassing, inclusive digital humanities may not\nalways seem an attractive option to it. Multitude and variation may be seen as dilut-\ning the field and taking away from a number of epistemic commitments. This is a\nvery valid concern, and various initiatives are bound to tackle this challenge in dif-\nferent ways. It would seem, however, that a big-tent digital humanities should not\nbe predominantly anchored in one tradition.\n\nEven if the big-tent vision of the digital humanities gives the field a sense of\nopenness and invitation, it does not necessarily remove institutional predisposi-\ntions and thresholds or make the field into a blank slate. The alternative model\nsuggested here, seeing the digital humanities as a trading zone and meeting place,\nplaces more emphasis on existing traditions and the intersectional work required to\nmake “big” digital humanities happen. Furthermore, this model acknowledges the\nadvantage of a liminal position and the digital as a way of connecting disciplines,\nperspectives, and methodologies. By seeing the field as a trading zone and meet-\ning place, we can acknowledge disciplinary and methodological expertise, while\napproaching grand challenges, relating key disciplinary discourses, supporting mul-\ntiple modes of engagement with the digital, and distinctly engaging with the future\nof the humanities.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n47\n\f"

ALVARADO\n\nLet’s be honest——there is no definition of digital humanities, if by definition we\nmean a consistent set of theoretical concerns and research methods that might be\naligned with a given discipline, whether one of the established fields or an emerging,\ntransdisciplinary one. The category denotes no set of widely shared computational\nmethods that contributes to the work of interpretation, no agreed upon norms\nor received genres for digital publication, no broad consensus on whether digital\nwork, however defined, counts as genuine academic work. Instead of a definition,\nwe have a genealogy, a network of family resemblances among provisional schools\nof thought, methodological interests, and preferred tools, a history of people who\nhave chosen to call themselves digital humanists and who in the process of trying\nto define the term are creating that definition. How else to characterize the mean-\ning of an expression that has nearly as many definitions as affiliates? It is a social\ncategory, not an ontological one.\n\nAs a social category, the term has a more or less clear set of organizational ref-\nerents. Recently Matt Kirschenbaum reminded us that there is a peer-reviewed jour-\nnal, a federal office, an annual conference, and an international network of academic\ncenters associated with the term, not to mention an Oxford Companion (“What\nIs”). However the gap between the social and the ontological cannot avoid appear-\ning as a kind of scandal. This is evident from the number of essays and blog posts\nthat have emerged seeking to define the category, as well as from the playfully com-\nbative and defensive tone some remarks have taken. This anxiety of self-definition\nseems to indicate a new phase in the history of the field, one that may indicate the\nemergence of a territorial instinct in an environment of scarce resources—even as\nthe language of the “big tent” emerges. After all, the shift from “humanities com-\nputing” to the “digital humanities” indexes a growth in the size and popularity of\nthe community. With growth comes growing pains.\n\nTo many, the digital humanities feels like a small town that has recently been\nrated as a great place to raise a family.

In the quest to defend old ways and invent new ones, in-groups are defined,\nprophets emerge, witchcraft accusations are made, and people generally lose what\ncommunal solidarity they once had. The digital humanities community has not\ngone this far, but one cannot help but notice the disparity between the Wood-\nstock feeling of THATCamp events and what appears to be the Altamont of Digital\nHumanities 2011.\n\nTo be sure, all digital humanists share a common bond as humanists, scholars\ndevoted to the interpretation of what the art historian Erwin Panofsky called “the\nrecords left by man (sic]” (5)—works of literature, art, architecture, and other prod-\nucts and traces of human intellectual labor. More specifically, the sorts of humanists\nwho have been drawn into the fold of digital humanities have had a distinct prefer-\nence toward textual remains, even if we entertain pleas to consider nonverbal chan-\nnels as well (usually originating from nontraditional fields, such as media studies).\nIt remains an implicit (if discomfiting) assumption among digital humanists that,\nas Tim Bray puts it (in the tag line for his website, Textuality.com), “knowledge is\na text based application.” Consistent with this view, the typical digital humanist\nis a literary scholar, historian, or librarian—all traditional fields concerned with\nthe management and interpretation of written documents. Others, such as myself,\ncome from other backgrounds; but I believe it is no accident that the recent buzz\nabout the discipline was spawned by talks given at the Modern Language Associa-\ntion (MLA) meetings.\n\nThere are also many schools of thought under the sign who do share, within\nthemselves, a more or less coherent set of methods and concerns. There is, of course,\n\nthe old guard of humanities computing, trained in the markup of textual sources\nusing the Text Encoding Initiative’s guidelines and schema and versed in the theoret-\nical implications of this mode of representation. There is a newer community who\nembraces the “spatial humanities” through the use of mapping software in relation\nto textual (and other) sources and who has shifted our attention toward. visualiza-\ntion and human geography—-an overlooked field that should rightly have its day.\nAlongside these there is a long-running group of statistical critics, extending from\nFather Busa and IBM to Franco Moretti and Google, as well as other computational\nhumanists who have been at it since the 1960s and who believe that counting words,\napplying the methods of computational linguistics, and observing patterns in large\ncorpora will produce insights unreachable by mere reading. One could also point\nto the Critical Code Studies group and other schools of thought that have emerged\nin this space.\nTaken as a whole, however, there is little connection among these groups beyond\na shared interest in texts and the use of computational technologies to explore and\n\n \n\nunderstand them (as opposed to merely creating or distributing them).

ALVARADO\n\ndemonstrated to the wider community of humanists that there are essential and\nirreplaceable gains to be had by the application of digital tools to the project of\ninterpreting (and reinterpreting) the human record for the edification of society. To\na disconcertingly large number of outsiders, the digital humanities qua humanities\nremains interesting but irrelevant. Anthony Grafton speaks for the majority when,\nin a recent New York Times piece (Cohen), he repeats the platitude that the digital\nhumanities is a means and not an end. Given his stature in the field, not to men-\ntion his role as president of the American Historical Association (AHA), his recent\nremarks regarding his experience of a presentation on Culturomics at the AHA\nmeetings in Boston (Grafton) may indicate a turning of the tide—but the conver-\nsion of other prominent scholars has not produced such shifts in the past.\n\nNow, if we use the term digital humanities and cannot define it, maybe we are\nthinking of such definitions in the wrong way. Maybe the traditional way of defin-\ning disciplines in the academy is all wrong. Instead of saying that physics is the study\nof matter and energy, or history the study of what people have done in the past,\nmaybe we should say that physics is the work of those who read Newton and Ein-\nstein, who use various branches of mathematics, and who know how to construct\nexperiments in a certain way. Or history is the work of people who know how to\nnavigate archives and read old tax records and diaries and other textual remains,\nwhereas archacologists are those who know how to manage digs and how to retrieve,\nclassify, and interpret shards and bones.\n\nThis may sound forced for the hard sciences, but it is eminently reasonable for\nthe humanities and social sciences. For what are the real differences between history,\nsociology, economics, anthropology, and archaeology? Each claims to address the\nstructure and function of society. The answer is that each has mastered a particular\ndomain of data—its acquisition, organization, analysis, and interpretation. Sociolo-\ngists do surveys and statistics, interviews and content analysis. Cultural anthropolo-\ngists do fieldwork and thick description. Economists count indicators and develop\nequations to relate them. Historians are very good at converting old documents and\narchives into stories. When an archacologist starts to read such documents, we say\nshe is doing “historical archaeology?’ Document-reading anthropologists become\nethnohistorians. And so forth.\n\nSuch a definition (which philosophers will recognize as a species of pragma-\ntism) allows us to turn our attention to the practical and situated basis of the digi-\ntal humanities. In this view, digital humanists are simply humanists (or interpre-\ntive social scientists) by training who have embraced digital media and who have\na more or less deep conviction that digital media can play a crucial, indeed trans-\nformative, role in the work of interpretation, broadly conceived. Beyond this all\nbets are off.

The former subjects primary source texts to digital\nrepresentation by means of code-—-XML, XSLT, and so on—whereas the latter treats\ncode itself as text, seeking to apply principles of interpretation theory (hermeneu-\ntics, structuralism, etc.) to programming languages and, one hopes, markup lan-\nguages as well. (One might include here Kirschenbaum’s Mechanisms: New Media\nand the Forensic Imagination, which treats hardware itself as text.) As Stephen\nRamsay has argued (“Toward”), practitioners of the former approach can be curi-\nously uncritical of their tools and methods, checking their postmodernist perspec-\ntives at the door of the lab.\n\nConsider also the case of databases. On the one hand, many scholars supple-\nment their research by using data management tools to organize notes and ref-\nerences. On the other hand, there is an emerging school of thought, initiated by\nLev Manovich, that regards the database itself as an object of criticism in its own\nright (Manovich). The difference between the two approaches is like night and day,\nalthough one can imagine how one may profit from the other. Still a third mode of\nintersection is to regard technology as an allegory of textuality. For example, Wendy\nHui Kyong Chun has employed the image of the fiber optic network as a frame for\nthe interpretation of digitally mediated social interaction and text (Chun). So not\nonly are there as many kinds of digital humanities as there are intersections between\n\n \n\nhumanities and computation technology, but that number is at least tripled, in prin-\nciple, by the kind of relationship that inheres in that intersection. To a humanist,\nany computational technology is potentially tool, text, and metaphor.\n\nGiven this surplus of extensional meanings, there is simply no way to describe\nthe digital humanities as anything like a discipline. Just think of the curricular\nrequirements of such a field! Not only would it require its members to develop the\ndeep domain knowledge of the traditional humanist—distant reading notwith-\nstanding—it would also demand that they learn a wide range of divergent technol-\nogies (including programming languages) as well as the critical discourses to situ-\nate these technologies as texts, cultural artifacts participating in the reproduction of\nsocial and cognitive structures. Granted the occasional polymath who may master\nall three, the scope of such a program is simply too vast and variegated. And in fact\nthere has been no consensus among digital humanists about the basic elements of\na curriculum, a problem we share with advocates of media fluency to define a cur-\nriculum for faculty development.\n\nSo if the digital humanities is neither in fact nor in principle a discipline, then\nwhat is it? Surely, with its growing army of followers and plethora of concrete insti-\ntutional manifestations, it must have some basis in a reality other than its own\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\nwn\noe\n\f"

The digital humanities, as both a broad collection of prac-\ntices and an intense, ongoing interpretive praxis generative of such practices, is best\nthought of as having two very concrete but equally elusive dimensions. On the one\nhand, the digital humanities (conceived of in the plural) comprises something very\nmutch like a curriculum, an interrelated collection of subject domains and resources\nthat, as a whole, contributes to both the construction of knowledge and the educa-\ntion of people. Although no one individual can master an entire curriculum, a cur-\nriculum nevertheless has a logic, a coherence, and even a center of gravity.\n\nThis leads to the second and more important dimension: that center of gravity\nis not a particular assemblage of technologies or methods but the ongoing, play-\nful encounter with digital representation itself. It is the encounter that the digital\nhumanist discovers and finds at once a revealing, satisfying, and ineffable source of\nfellow feeling with his colleagues. This encounter is not regarded merely as a means\nto an end but as an end in itself, in so much as the process of interpretation is often\nas rewarding as its products. [call this encounter the situation of digital representa-\ntion, a stable but always-in-flux event space that is but a special case of the work, or\npraxis, of representation in general. Adult members of literate cultures for the most\npart have sublimated and forgotten this praxis, but it remains present to the minds\nof children and poets, who are always learning how to read and write.\n\nThis, I believe, is what Stephen Ramsay means by “building” (“On Building”).\nOr at least it is a charitable misreading (misprision) that retrieves the argument he\nmakes when he suggests, essentially, that real digital humanists write code. In my\nrephrasing, real digital humanists are engaged in the play of representation, which\nprofoundly involves putting things together, whether the vehicle of assembly be Lisp\nor Zotero. That marks a wide spectrum; but within it there is a common element of\nplay, of productively mapping and remapping the objects and categories of schol-\narship onto the rapidly changing, intrinsically plastic but structurally constraining\nmedia of digital technology. Without this play——to the extent that the scholar has\na standoffish, do-this-for-me attitude toward the medium—then, no, she is not a\ndigital humanist.\n\nDigital humanists are aware that in the current historical moment, as the older\nmentalités of print literacy continue to be displaced and reworked, the humanist\nhas the opportunity to immerse herself in the transductive plasma of interpretation\nwhere ideas and their expressive vehicles can be mapped and remapped in a variety\nof forms and frameworks, a giddy play of praxis that not all generations have the\ngood fortune of witnessing. This experience cross-cuts all the various discipline-\nand technology-specific instances of digital humanities work. To the extent that a\ncommon discourse is emerging to reflect on this experience across the disciplines,\nthe digital humanities is real enough.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

What humanities arguments does digital\nhumanities make?\n\nConcern over the apparent lack of argument in digital humanities comes not\nonly from outside our young discipline. Many practicing digital humanists are con-\ncerned about it as well. Rob Nelson of the University of Richmond’s Digital Scholar-\nship Lab, an accomplished. digital humanist, recently ruminated, “While there have\nbeen some projects that have been developed to present arguments, they are few,\nand for the most part I sense that they haven't had a substantial impact among aca-\ndemics, at least in the field of history? A post on the Humanist listserv, which has\ncovered humanities computing for over two decades, expresses one digital human-\nist’s “dream” of “a way of interpreting with computing that would allow arguments,\nreal arguments, to be conducted at the micro-level and their consequences made in\neffect instantly visible at the macro-level”!\n\nThese concerns are justified. Does digital humanities have to help answer ques-\ntions and make arguments? Yes, of course. That's what the humanities are all about.\nIs it answering lots of questions currently? Probably not-—hence the reason for\nworry.\n\nBut this suggests another, more difficult, more nuanced question: When? When\ndoes digital humanities have to produce new arguments? Does it have to produce\nnew arguments now? Does it have to answer questions yet?\n\nIn 1703, the great instrument maker, mathematician, and experimenter Robert\nHooke died, vacating the suggestively named position he occupied for more than\nforty years, curator of experiments to the Royal Society. In this role, it was Hooke’s\njob to prepare public demonstrations of scientific phenomena for the fellows’\nmeetings.

Part research, part\nice breaker, and part theater, one important function of these performances was to\nentertain the wealthier fellows of the society, many of whom were chosen for elec-\ntion more for their patronage than their scientific achievements.\n\nUpon Hooke’s death, the position of curator of experiments passed to Fran-\ncis Hauksbee, who continued Hooke’s program of public demonstrations. Many of\nHauksbee’s demonstrations involved the “electrical machine,” essentially an evacu-\nated glass globe that was turned on an axle and to which friction (a hand, a cloth, a\npiece of fur) was applied to produce a static electrical charge. Invented some years\nearlier, Hauksbee greatly improved the device to produce ever greater charges. Per-\nhaps his most important improvement was the addition to the globe of a small\namount of mercury, which produced a glow when the machine was fired up. In\nan age of candlelight and on a continent of long, dark winters, the creation of a\nnew source of artificial light was sensational and became a popular learned enter-\ntainment not only in meetings of early scientific societies but also in aristocratic\nparlors across Europe. Hauksbee’s machine also set off an explosion of electrical\ninstrument making, experimentation, and descriptive work in the first half of the\neighteenth century by the likes of Stephen Gray, John Desaguliers, and Pieter van\nMusschenbroek.\n\nAnd yet not until later in the eighteenth century and early in the nineteenth cen-\ntury did Benjamin Franklin, Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, Alessandro Volta, and\nultimately Michael Faraday provide adequate theoretical and mathematical answers\nto the questions of electricity raised by the electrical machine and the phenomena\nit produced. Only after decades of tool building, experimentation, and description\nwere the tools sufficiently articulated and phenomena sufficiently described for the-\noretical arguments to be fruitfully made?\n\nThere’s a moral to this story. As I have argued in an earlier post, this kind of\ndrawn-out, longue duree, seasonal shifting between methodological and theoreti-\ncal work isn’t confined to the sciences. One of the things digital humanities shares\nwith the sciences is a heavy reliance on instruments, on tools. Sometimes new tools\nare built to answer preexisting questions. Sometimes, as in the case of Hauksbee’s\nelectrical machine, new questions and answers are the byproduct of the creation of\nnew tools. Sometimes it takes a while; in the meantime, tools themselves and the\nwhiz-bang effects they produce must be the focus of scholarly attention.\n\nEventually, digital humanities must make arguments. It has to answer questions.\nBut yet? Like eighteenth-century natural philosophers confronted with a deluge of\nstrange new tools like microscopes, air pumps, and electrical machines, maybe we\nneed time to articulate our digital apparatus, to produce new phenomena that we\ncan neither anticipate nor explain immediately. At the very least, we need to make\nroom for both kinds of digital humanities, the kind that seeks to make arguments\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n(57\n\f"

            "result": " \n\nWhy Digital Humanities Is “Nice”\n\nTOM SCHEINFELDT\n\nOne of the things that people often notice when they enter the field of digital human-\nities is how nice everybody is. This can be in stark contrast to other (unnamed) disci-\nplines where suspicion, envy, and territoriality sometimes seem to rule. By contrast,\nour most commonly used bywords are “collegiality,” “openness,” and “collabora-\ntion.” We welcome new practitioners easily, and we don’t seem to get in lots of\nfights. We're the golden retrievers of the academy. (OK, it’s not always all balloons\nand cotton candy, but most practitioners will agree that the tone and tenor of digi-\ntal humanities is conspicuously amiable when compared to many, if not most, aca-\ndemic communities.)\n\nThere are several reasons for this. Certainly the fact that nearly all digital human-\nities is collaborative accounts for much of its congeniality—you have to get along\nto get anything accomplished. The fact that digital humanities is still young, small,\nvulnerable, and requiring of solidarity also counts for something.\n\nBut [have another theory: Digital humanities is nice because, as I have described\nin earlier posts, we're often more concerned with method than we are with theory.\nWhy should a focus on method make us nice? Because methodological debates are\noften more easily resolved. than theoretical ones. Critics approaching an issue with\nsharply opposed theories may argue endlessly over evidence and interpretation.\nPractitioners facing a methodological problem may likewise argue over which tool\nor method to use. Yet at some point in most methodological debates one of two\nthings happens: either one method or another wins out empirically, or the prac-\ntical needs of our projects require us simply to pick one and move on. Moreover,\nas Sean Takats, my colleague at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New\n\n \n\nMedia (CHNM), pointed out to me today, the methodological focus makes it easy\nfor us to “call bullshit.” If anyone takes an argument too far afield, the community\nof practitioners can always put the argument to rest by asking to see some working\ncode, a useable standard, or some other tangible result.\n\nIn each case, the focus on method means that arguments are short, and digital\nhumanities stays nice.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Under the digital humanities rubric, I\nwould include topics like open access to materials, intellectual property rights, tool\ndevelopment, digital libraries, data mining, born-digital preservation, multimedia\npublication, visualization, GIS, digital reconstruction, study of the impact of tech-\nnology on numerous fields, technology for teaching and learning, sustainability\nmodels, media studies, and many others.

Reading, writing, learning—three things that are pretty central to the\nhumanities.\n\nIn terms of interesting innovations, I think a lot of them surround technology\nand how it helps you interact with humanities collections. At its heart, technology\nallows you to manipulate and interact with “stuff” in different ways. The stuff might\nbe music; it might be video; it might be text; it might be images of objects. (It might\neven be people.) Before we look at humanities scholarship, let me throw out an anal-\nogy. Consider how, in a very short period of time, technology has changed popular\nmusic. Let’s break music down to three key areas:\n\nAccess, Putting music in digital format has completely changed the access para-\ndigm. I remember back when I was in college. I was the station manager for my cam-\npus radio station (University of Chicago, WHPK 88.5, “Cold kickin it live!”). At the\ntime, before the web and a few years before CDs came out, music was still remark-\nably regional. Whenever I was heading home to New York to visit my family, station\nDJs would ask me to buy records for them. Think about that for a moment—even\nin Chicago, one of the biggest cities in the country, there were many, many records\nyou could get your hands on. So in order to get the latest rap records coming out\nof New York or even a lot of imports from the UK, you had to fly to another city and\nbring vinyl back in your suitcase. The Internet completely and utterly changed that.\nToday, you can listen to a band from Australia as easily as one from your hometown.\n\nProduction and Distribution. Just a few years ago, it was nearly impossible for\nan unsigned band to get their music to a wide audience. Trust me, as the former\nhead of a college radio station, most bands couldn't even make a demo tape that\ndidn’t sound horrible. But technology allows anyone with a home computer to\nrecord their music, and the web allows them to distribute it to anyone in the world.\n\nConsumption (Listening). Digital files have enabled people to have much,\nmutch larger collections of music than they could physically store before. (Piracy\nhelped, too, but that’s another, related issue.) I carry my entire music collection on\nan iPod. This changes the way you listen, what you listen to, and the way you share\nmusic with others.\n\nNow let’s look at these three areas again (Access, Production, and Consump-\ntion) but in the context of humanities scholarship. What do humanists do? Well, a\nbig part of what they do is study cultural heritage materials—books, newspapers,\npaintings, film, sculptures, music, ancient tablets, buildings, and so on. Pretty much\neverything on that list is being digitized in very large numbers. The change in access\nmay not be quite as far along as it is for music, but it will be soon. Like with music,\nyou'll have access to materials from all over the world. You won't have to send.a book\nvia airmail from New York to Chicago because you'll have instant access to iton your\nPC (or your mobile device). If you want to study materials in China, you'll be able\nto view them (or, for that matter, find out about them) using the web.\n\nOn the production side, we're already seeing more and more scholars produc-\ning their work for the web. It might take the form of scholarly websites, blogs, wikis,\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:18 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

But as with music, a scholar (even an amateur, part-time scholar) can\nmake her work available to the entire world at very low cost of production. After all,\nscholars still have to eat and so be compensated for what they do best—the analysis\nof scholarly materials and being part of the larger scholarly conversation (so pro-\nduction and transmission of knowledge). Plus, keep in mind that the entire pro-\nduction cycle uses technology (collecting, editing, discussing with others) before\nthe final product is created.\n\nOn the consumption side, people get their materials in all kinds of new ways.\nReading has changed with the web. It has changed from a technology perspective,\nof course—thinking of e-readers and laptops and mobile devices (and some of\nthe now-starting-to-get-obsolete tech products like microfiche machines). But the\nchanges are more profound than that. The way we read is changing—bits and pieces\nof varied content from so many places and perspectives.\n\nIf] had to predict some interesting things for the future in the area of access, I'd\nsum it up in one word: scale. Big, massive, scale. That’s what digitization brings—\naccess to far, far more cultural heritage materials than you could ever access before.\nIf you're a scholar of, say, nineteenth-century British literature, how does your work\nchange when, for the first time, you have every book from your era at your finger-\ntips? Far more books than you could ever read in your lifetime. How does this scale\nchange things? How might quantitative tech-based methodologies like data mining\nhelp you to better understand a giant corpus? Help you zero in on issues? What if\nyou are a historian and you now have access to every newspaper around the world?\nHow might searching and mining that kind of data set radically change your results?\nHow might well-known assumptions in various disciplines fall once confronted\nwith hard data? Or, perhaps, how might they be altered or reenvisioned?\n\n2. How do you see digital technology transforming work in the disciplines of the\nhumanities? Are there disciplines in which digital technology will have less of an\nimpact?\nIn my earlier answer, I spoke about how access to large collections of digitized cul-\ntural heritage materials will transform the humanities. So let’s also talk a bit about\ndigital research tools and methodologies and their impact.\n\nMore and more scholars are starting to take advantage of digital research tools.\nLet me note that pretty much every scholar uses a digital tool for her work: namely,\na word processor. And I’m sure there must be all kinds of interesting papers about\nhow a word processor and its ability to edit and reedit on the fly has changed schol-\narship. But we don’t even talk about a word processor as a digital tool anymore. But\nthat’s really the point here. What might seem novel at first can become accepted\neven by “regular” humanities scholars over time. There are all kinds of interesting\ntools and methodologies.

Scholars have always consumed materials to gain\ninsight into why an event happened (or why the artist drew a painting that way, or\nwhy an ancient temple was constructed, etc.). Visualization may prove to be another\ntechnology that can help scholars see their materials in a new way.\n\nThere are many, many digital tools that scholars use every day to collaborate,\nto organize their work, and to publish it to the community. ] suspect that many of\nthese digital practices will become the norm. The tools will change (many will die\nout), but useful methods will stick. By the way, for a nice list of digital tools for the\nhumanities, see Lisa Spiro’s DiRT Wiki (Spiro).\n\nDigital technology may impact some disciplines more than others. But frankly,\nthis is hard to predict. Obviously, subdisciplines like game studies are very tech\nheavy. But who would have guessed that classics would be one of the most digitally\nsavvy disciplines?\n\n3. What roadblocks are scholars in the digital humanities encountering, and\nwhat advice do you have for graduate students and junior faculty?\n\nThe roadblock issue is much discussed. It seems like every conference I go to there\nis discussion of promotion and tenure issues, so this is certainly a big topic. Let\nme preface this by saying that Pm not a scholar myself; ’'m a government grant\nmaker and technologist. I say this because I want to make it clear that I can’t speak\nauthoritatively about how P&T (promotion and tenure) works on your campus.\nThat said, my impression is that on some campuses, graduate students and junior\nfaculty are strongly encouraged to steer away from digital scholarship and instead\nto write about “traditional” topics and publish “traditional” monographs. On the\nother hand, I do hear about more and more campuses where digital scholarship is\nhighly valued and counted toward promotion.\n\nLhave a few thoughts here. First, | think it is important for people throughout\nthe humanities community to understand that digital scholarship doesn’t have to\nmean nontraditional. In other words, to get back to my word processor issue, have\nyou ever heard someone say to a young philosopher, “Oh, you better not write your\nbook about Aristotle using a word processor! Someone will think youre one of those\ncrazy digital humanists and you wort get tenure!” This example seems silly, but keep\nin mind that it wasn’t all that long ago that a word processor was newfangled tech-\nnology. My point is that you can tackle “traditional” humanities topics and ques-\ntions while still using the latest digital tools if you find it adds value to your work.\nMaybe you used data-mining techniques to see how Aristotle influenced other phi-\nlosophers. That's great, but the focus of your book should be the results (the schol-\narship) and not necessarily the techniques you used.\n\nOne issue I'd like to see graduate programs tackle: more training in digital tools\nand. methodologies for humanities scholarship.

But how many graduate\nhumanities programs include classes on using GIS, 3-D modeling, data analysis, or\nother methods of scholarship? I suspect the number is fairly low. 1 wonder if this\nisn’t an area more graduate programs should be exploring.\n\n4, How will digital technology in the academic system in general (for example, in\nthe changing role of textbooks in the classroom, open-access databases, or pub-\nlishing requirements for tenure) affect the way research is performed and shared?\nI think research will change a great deal over the next twenty years. We have already\nseen this in the sciences where mining “big data” has changed the way scientists do\ntheir research (Anderson). Imagine a future where we have huge digital libraries of\nfar more material than you ever had access to before. Now imagine automatic lan-\nguage translation for those documents, which greatly increases your ability to study\ndocuments from around the globe.\n\nLet’s face it: sometimes scholarship is constrained by seemingly mundane hur-\ndles like copyright, travel costs, or language barriers. Let’s take art history for a\nmoment. If you're an art historian and you want to write a book about French paint-\ners and you get the rights to reproduce the paintings of Renoir but not Monet, which\nartist will you choose to focus on? You'll probably write a lot more about Renoir for\nstrictly practical reasons. What if yourre a political philosopher and you can read\nEnglish, French, and Greek but not Chinese? Might there be incredible literature in\nChinese that would help you understand how ideas moved through cultures and\nacross languages? But if you can’t read it, you probably won't focus on it.\n\n5.

Of\ncourse, being the government, I can’t exactly make the peer review criteria “coolness\nfactor” and expect the lawyers to be OK with that! In all seriousness, though, we're\nlooking for innovative projects that demonstrate how technology can be brought\nto bear on a humanities problem and, ultimately, yield great scholarship for use by\na variety of audiences, whether it be scholars, students in a formal classroom set-\nting, or the interested public.\n\nAdministrators and researchers who are interested in applying to the Office of\nDigital Humanities should definitely check out the projects we have already funded.\n(They are all easy to find on our website; check out our Library of Funded Projects\nat http://www.neh.gov/ODH.) It is also important to understand how to work col-\nlaboratively. So many of today’s digital projects involve teams of people from vari-\nous disciplines.

In\norder to increase the geographical spread covered\nby our corpus, we supplemented the Ulster annals\nusing the Annals of Loch Cé (ed. Hennessy, 1871)\nwhich share a common core with the Annals of\nUlster from their beginning in 1014 down to the\nstart of the thirteenth century (Mac Niocaill, 1975,\n29) but otherwise have a more western focus.\n\nThe digital editions used in this study are taken\nfrom the CELT (Corpus of Electronic Texts) project\nat https://celt.ucc.ie/. Its texts are based on the\nprinted editions listed above but with the incorpor-\nation of some corrections and some standardisation\nof the representation of symbols. They have been\ntagged following TEI guidelines for annal dates,\nnames, and language (chiefly Latin and Irish), but\nthey have not been parsed.\n\nAs the long-term aim of this project is to provide\na generic tool for dating texts in the Irish language,\nwe removed any Latin words from the corpus. We\nalso removed any roman numbers that might\nencode the date, and after pre-processing any\nannals of less than five words. The training set of\nthe combined corpus consists of 4,780 texts corres-\nponding to single annal entries, where each year\nmay contain several entries or none, and the test\nset contains 846 texts.\n\n3.3 Classification and evaluation\n\nOur dating experiment of classification with flex-\nible time intervals mainly consists of tuning 5’ and\n\ntraining multi-class classifiers. We did 10-fold\ncross-validation on training sets of the four cor-\npora, which also reasonably estimated the general\nperformance of a relevant dating system. A whole\ntraining set was randomly divided into 10 folds,\none fold was held for tuning 6’ by optimizing the\ndating accuracy on it, and basic classifiers with\ncertain interval width 8’ were trained on the re-\nmaining 9 folds. Sorting the averaged dating\naccuracies gave us the optimum value of 8’.\n\nWe chose as classification features character\nand word n-grams (n = 1, 2, and 3), the top two\neffective ones reported by Szymanski and Lynch\n(2015). The advantage is that these features are\nreadily available in texts and requires much less\nprocessing effort than POS or syntax etc.\nNumbers of features were determined to com-\npromise between accuracy and running time of a\nbasic classifier on the Fine granularity, ie. 6 = 3.\nThus, for SVM 1,462 tokens were kept before\nusing n-gram string-to-vector filtering, and 4,512\nfor NBM (Naive Bayes Multinomial). For the\nmedieval Irish corpora, we currently use only\ncharacter n-grams (m = 1, 2, and 3), and 3,800\ntokens were kept before using n-gram string-to-\nvector filtering to ensure the classification per-\nformance of basic NBM classifier with 6 = 3.\n\n4.1 Dating English texts\n\nUsing Weka 3.7 (Witten et al., 2011) Java Library’,\nwe implemented our method with the Support\nVector Machine (SVM) and NBM for dating texts\nin the English newspaper corpus.

To make predictions for\na text in the test set, we assigned it whichever given\nyear range of the DTE format that had the greatest\noverlap with our dated flexible time interval.\nDating performance is evaluated, as explained in\nTable 1: Step 6 and 7, by the ratio of how many\ntimes the method successfully determined the\nDTE defined time intervals.

In moments of general fiscal austerity, class sizes\na. in the humanities have risen, departments and programs have been threat-\nened or eliminated, and searches for open faculty positions have been abandoned.\nEven in times of stable budgets, tenure-track positions have remained elusive, and\nresources available to those scholars doing work in the humanities have been scarce.\nThis context has been so persistent that it has taken on an air of permanence.\n\nThe general implications for instruction and pedagogical innovation in the\nhumanities from this “new normal” are well documented: contact time with stu-\ndents has declined, and the ratio of classes being taught by contingent faculty has\nincreased. General education curricula have, for the most part, not kept pace with\nchanges in institutional structure that have led to more adjuncts teaching larger\nclasses with strained institutional support. Most university curricula have not\nadjusted to the material realities of the college experience, where the vast majority\nof students lead lives that are exponentially more digital and networked than they\nwere when those curricula were designed. General education requirements have\nnot been sufficiently reoriented to the changing demands of the job market, which\nrequire, at the very least, that students be able to navigate increasingly complicated\ninformation systems. Most universities have failed to relay to students why study-\ning the humanities is important or relevant in this context, and so it is little wonder\nthat ever-increasing percentages of students are landing in nonhumanities majors,\nchoosing instead courses of study that promise to certify them for a specific place\nin the economy, which may or may not in fact exist (Menand, 50-54).\n\nThese conditions are encouraging too many coilege students to see knowledge\nas something they purchase in the form of a degree, as opposed to something flex-\nible and broadly applicable that they gain through deep, engaging experience.

In this context, pedagogy, curriculum development, and the scholarship\nof teaching and learning remain what Steve Brier has called “the ugly stepchildren\nof the university.’ Those particular paths of inquiry continue to be undervalued by\ninstitutions and less energetically pursued by academics than the discipline-based\nresearch with which the majority of humanists began their careers.\n\nIn contrast to these troubling realities, the digital humanities appear to be on\nthe ascendance. The job market for academic humanists in the past three years\nhas been the weakest in over a generation, yet jobs in the digital humanities are\nbecoming more plentiful. In 2010 through 2011, there were cluster hires of digi-\ntal humanities faculty at a number of research universities, including the Univer-\nsity of Iowa, Georgia State University, the University of Maryland, and the Univer-\nsity of Wisconsin, among others. There has also been an increase in what Bethany\nNowviskie has called “#alt-ac” positions doing the digital humanities—“alternative\nacademic careers”——including postdocs, jobs in libraries, and administrative and\nstaff positions at newly founded or expanding digital humanities centers (“falt-\nac”). New conferences and camps seem to emerge monthly, and they're always well\nattended despite eroding travel support from colleges and universities. The Alli-\nance of Digital Humanities Organizations, formed in 2005, brings together previ-\nously disparate international organizations, supports five influential journals, and\norganizes a massive annual conference in the field. At each of the past two Mod-\nern Language Association meetings—perhaps the most influential general meeting\nin the humanities—various reports lauded “the arrival of the digital humanities”\n(Pannapaker; Howard; and “News: Tweetup at the MLA’). Although the extent to\nwhich that arrival is complete has been debated, there can be little argument that\nthe field is a more significant presence in the academy than it was ten, or even five,\nyears ago. With the increase in the number of humanists who blog and use Twitter,\nthe digital humanities conversation is always happening.\n\n \n\nContributing to this sense of arrival, beyond the jobs and intensifying dis-\ncourse, was the creation of an Office of the Digital Humanities (ODH) at the\nNational Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 2008. The ODH funded 145\nprojects from 2008 through spring of 2011; and, while its annual operating bud-\nget of around 4.5 million dollars pales in comparison to endowments managed\nby many universities and the investments in university-based research and devel-\nopment made by science and industry over the past half century, the initiative\nhas been extremely influential in shaping the progression of the digital humani-\nties in American colleges, universities, libraries, and museums (National Endow-\nment for the Humanities 2011). Other funding sources over the past half decade—\nsuch as the MacArthur Foundation’s HASTAC Digital Media and Learning Grants\n(forty-four multiyear awards ranging in funding from forty-five thousand dol-\nlars to more than five million dollars), Google’s 2010 Digital Humanities Research\nAwards (twelve one- to two-year grants totaling almost one million dollars), and\nthe Andrew Mellon Foundation’s Grants to universities (totaling more than one\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:25 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

Even though “humanities computing” has been\naround in some capacity for over half a century, we seem, in the past few years, to\nhave reached a tipping point that has made the digital humanities more permanent\nand influential within the academic landscape (Kirschenbaum, “Digital Humani-\nties As/Is a Tactical Term”).\n\nThe discordance between a roiled university system where the very role of the\nhumanities is being challenged and an obviously invigorated subfield begs pause\nand deeper consideration. This task is made easier by the fact that much work in the\ndigital humanities over the past two years has been keenly self-aware. This very vol-\nume itself is intended to highlight some key debates in an effort to clarify the field.\nYet few scholars or practitioners have directly addressed the glaring tension between\na subfield that booms while its parent struggles to maintain footing.\n\nThough work in the digital humanities has done much to reorient academic\nthinking to new information and communication realities, it has not yet done\nenough to show how the values and lessons at the core of the field might reshape\nthe role of the humanities in the university of the future. What’s troubling is that it\ncould. More so than just about any other subfield, the digital humanities possess the\ncapability to invigorate humanities instruction in higher education and to reassert\n\n \n\nhow the humanities can help us understand and shape the world around us. Every\ncollege student engages some form of humanistic inquiry in order to fulfill general\neducation requirements. Even beyond general education, regardless of discipline,\nthe very idea of a “curriculum” requires that faculty and administrators delve into\nthe questions of, what must our students learn in their time on campus, and how?\nDebating how knowledge is and should be made necessitates a certain amount of\nhumanistic inquiry, and to be most relevant such processes must be acclimated to\nthe technological and communicative revolution within which we are living. There\nare multiple paths, then, for work in the digital humanities to influence the future\nof higher education in vibrant ways. Even Stanley Fish has found in the digital\nhumanities a rejoinder to those administrators “who still think of the humanities\nas the province of precious insights that offer little to those who are charged with\nthe task of making sense of the world” (Fish).\n\nDigital humanists are certainly aware of this potential. As Matthew Kirschen-\nbaum has noted, “What is digital humanities?’ essays .. . are already genre pieces”\n(“What Is the Digital Humanities and What's It Doing in English Departments?”).\nThere are several lines of argument within this genre, yet the common streak that\nruns through most is the belief that the digital humanities, whatever its boundar-\nies, does and must continue to generate ideas that can transform what it means to\ndo the humanities (Ramsay; Svensson 2011; Pressner and Schnapp et al.).

Interventions into each of these areas of academic\nlife relentlessly assert the values of openness, community, collaboration, democracy,\nand getting stuff done.\n\nThese values are professed and expressed in online conversations and in con-\nferences by colleagues communicating across institutions, and those discussions\nand. efforts to build community are undoubtedly good things. But interventions\nfrom the digital humanities into the various roles that the humanities play within\nindividual colleges and universities have been far less forceful and assertive, and it's\nhere where the upward trajectory of the field comes into starkest tension with the\ntenuous place of the humanities in American higher education. Even though many\ndigital humanists think and speak of themselves and their work as rising in opposi-\ntion to the traditional structures of the academy, much current work in the digital\nhumanities also values research and scholarship far more than teaching, learning,\nand curriculum development. In this sense, the digital humanities are hard to dis-\ntinguish significantly from other academic disciplines.\n\nThe “ugly stepchildren” of the university need protection, attention, and rein-\nvigoration as higher education undergoes wrenching changes. Of course, it shouldn't\nbe up to any single subfield to save the parent field or the university. Humanities\ncomputing and the digital humanities have never really taken on the university asa\nsubject. As has been written elsewhere, the digital humanities is not new but rather\nis the latest stage of inquiry at the intersection of digits and the humanities that\nstretches back to the 1940s. This history reads much like the development of a tra-\nditional research subfield, one that values esoteric knowledge and has been mostly\npropelled by literature scholars who used computers to index text and examine large\ndata sets. The field has gone through periods of professionalization, standardization,\ncollaboration with industry, and incursions by other subdisciplines, such as when\nhistorians explored cliometrics in the 1970s (Schreibman, Siemens, and Unsworth;\nHockey; and Thomas).\n\nThe advent of the World Wide Web has been the single most influential devel-\nopment in the field in the past two decades. Earlier uses of the web in the humanities\nwere oriented toward making scholarship and methodologies more widely acces-\nsible and to exploring the implications of embedding various media within texts.\nCurrent uses of the web within the digital humanities are extending these projects\nbut are also more fully embracing the connective possibilities of the Internet.

For much of its history, humanities computing was\nthe realm of seasoned specialists whose search for deeper understanding of a par-\nticular field brought them to digital tools: the Austen scholar who wondered what\nmeaning might be unveiled by crunching the words in her texts and. by extension\nhow such understandings might alter criticism or linguistic analysis, or the Civil War\nhistorian who sought to tell the story of two communities during the war by pre-\nsenting various primary sources chronologically in close proximity to one another\nand inviting the visitor to perform some research——in the process creating a new\nmodel for how archives and libraries might approach the web (Burrows; Ayers). In\nthe past few years, however, work and prestige in the digital humanities, because of\nthe combination of networks and opportunity, has spread both vertically and hor-\nizontally. Graduate students and junior scholars are more confidently embracing\nwhat digital tools can mean for their work and are more likely than their predeces-\nsors to imagine a career path that revolves around their identities as digital human-\nists. The digital humanities is no longer a field one arrives at through one’s research;\nit has become a destination in and of itself, a jumping-off point for the building of\na scholarly identity.\n\nThis is a moment of empowerment for many doing work in the field, and it\nfeatures movement from the periphery of American higher education toward. the\ncenter. When power relationships change, politics often come into play. The his-\ntory of the field has never been explicitly political, and its relationship with other\nattempts to transform the role of the humanities in the university system, such as\nthe residential college movement or the recurrent debates over general education,\nhas been incidental. Yet there have been a few noteworthy exceptions, and they sug-\ngest how the intersection of humanistic inquiry and technological innovation can\nbe harnessed to newly empower individuals or groups.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the City University of New York’s American Social His-\ntory Project and George Mason’s Center for History and New Media (now the Roy\nRosenzweig Center for History and New Media) were founded by social historians\nwho were deeply interested in how technology might popularize the study of his-\ntory from the bottom up. Randy Bass’s work at Georgetown, with the Crossroads\nand Visible Knowledge Projects and the Center for New Designs in Learning and\nScholarship, has explored how technology and the networks it enables can open up\npedagogical processes to inquiry, intervention, and reinvention. These projects were\neminently political not just because they emerged out of work in labor and social\nhistory but also because each asserted that technology is not merely a tool for doing\nwork along the lines that humanities academics have always pursued.

They were exceptional because they both produced great\nscholarship and focused on pedagogy and curriculum development. The most cel-\nebrated work in the digital humanities over the past decade has not often shared\nthose priorities but instead has revolved around the research, tool, and network\nbuilding that have always defined the field.\n\nThis is not to say that the current stage of work in the digital humanities is\ncompletely without politics. The celebration of openness, sharing, and collabo-\nration that prevails within the field is itself an attempt to be the type of change\ndigital humanists want to see in a more progressive university. The recognition\nof those of us, like me, who have ended up on the #alt-ac path as central to the\nhumanities is one of the sharper critiques that digital humanists have leveled at\nhigher education.’ These are people whose work is often support oriented and\nwho spend their time building curricula; organizing faculty development initia-\ntives; and planting, congealing, and connecting communities of practice. Yet when\nlooking at the #alt-ac landscape closely, it’s difficult to see how the demands of\nthat career path differ significantly from those of a tenure-track route. To qualify\nfor an #alt-ac position, one must show ability as a scholar by presenting at con-\nferences, keeping up with scholarship in multiple fields, and promoting one’s\nwork. To progress along an #alt-ac path, one must produce scholarship or other\ntypes of work on a similar scale and timeline as a faculty member, even though\nonly the rare #alt-ac position allows space and autonomy in the daily workflow\nfor scholarship of any type. These are overwhelmingly nontenure-track positions,\nand many are short term.\n\nThe very presence and growing prominence of #alt-ac work is evidence that\ncracks have opened in the academy that are being filled by talented people, many of\nwhom would prefer to be on the tenure track. If folks in the digital humanities had\ntheir way, those positions would not be space fillers but rather secure jobs that come\nwith allowances for some of the generative autonomy that faculty enjoy (“Alterna-\ntive Academic Careers”). Yet there is little indication that the labor structure of the\nacademy will adjust to accommodate the inglorious work that so many #alt-ac aca-\ndemics are actually doing. And beyond proclamations that these positions are nec-\nessary and valuable, a range of conditions limit the ability of those working in the\ndigital humanities to make a very forceful case that the university's labor structure\nshould evolve.\n\nOne of those conditions is the dependence of the digital humanities upon\ngrants. While the increase in funding available to digital humanities projects is wel-\ncome and has led to many innovative projects, an overdependence on grants can\nshape a field in a particular way. Grants in the humanities last a short period of\ntime, which make them unlikely to fund the long-term positions that are needed\nto mount any kind of sustained challenge to current employment practices in the\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:25 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

They are competitive, which can lead to skewed reporting on process\nand results, and reward polish, which often favors the experienced over the novice.\nThey are external, which can force the orientation of the organizations that compete\nfor them outward rather than toward the structure of the local institution and cre-\nates the pressure to always be producing. Tom Scheinfeldt, the managing director of\nthe Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, has noted the challenges of\nwinning and balancing enough grants to maintain stability in staffing (Scheinfeldt).\nEach of these components might potentially diminish the ability of groups doing\ndigital humanities work to transform colleges and universities and assert their val-\nues locally. And each also nudges the field toward research and tool building, pur-\nsuits that produce more demonstrably tangible results than innovations focused on\nhard-to-measure areas like curriculum and pedagogy.\n\nThere is ample evidence that the grant procedures in the digital humani-\nties are fair, welcoming to newcomers, and supportive of projects at a variety of\nstages. The NEH’s ODH especially is well known for its openness, availability,\nand support during grant application processes and after grants are awarded and\nfor building community between the projects it funds. But the “Common Ques-\ntions” section of the NEH’s website notes that the “NEH does not fund projects\nthat deal solely with pedagogical theory or that are intended to improve writ-\ning, speaking, or thinking skills apart from a focus on specific humanities con-\ntent.” A generous reading of this guidance to visitors would acknowledge that\npedagogical theory designed around specific humanities content is often more\nstrongly constructed. And a preceding statement does note that one of the goals\nof the grants is to “strengthen teaching and learning in schools and colleges.” But\nin a less generous reading, this statement implies that pedagogy and curricula are\nsecondary factors in the humanities. This is reflected among the many pioneer-\ning projects supported by the NEH. Though many will likely produce resources\nthat are valuable in the classroom, there are currently very few that have focused\nspecifically on the undergraduate student as humanities doer (National Endow-\nment for the Humanities, “Videos of 2010 DH Start-Up Grant Lightning Round\nPresentations”).\n\nThe belief that work and prestige in the digital humanities has focused more\non tools and scholarship than on pedagogy and curricula is present beyond the\nconsideration of funding. Katherine Harris has argued that “teaching is invisible\nlabor” repeatedly on her blog, on Twitter, and at conferences, noting that in the\ndigital humanities this is just as true as it is elsewhere. Her comments are imbued\nwith the insider/outsider tension that many academics feel and talk about when it\ncomes to the digital humanities. 4/4 teaching loads and full administrative plates\nhamper the ability of many scholars to keep up with the conversation and to con-\ntribute to new work in the digital humanities.

In the wake of widespread. confusion about\nwhich papers got accepted to the Digital Humanities 2011 Conference—a confer-\nence devoted to “Big Tent Digital Humanities’—-Alex Reid sensed that the field\nwas rejecting large questions about the impact of technology on the contemporary\nhuman condition and reverting to a focus on software writing, indexing, and data\nmining. “Perhaps humanists, digital and otherwise, would prefer to cede questions\nof literacy, pedagogy, and contemporary media to other non-humanistic or quasi-\nhumanistic fields,” he concluded (Reid).\n\nAlan Liu has argued that digital humanists should do more to engage and\ntransform the traditional social and political role of the humanities both inside\nand beyond the university. He traces the vectors through which work in the digital\nhumanities has pushed practices in the humanities in new directions: from “writ-\ning to authoring/collaborating, from “reading to social computing,” from “inter-\npreting to data-mining,” from “critical judgment to information credibility,’ from\n“peer reviewing to commenting,” and from “teaching to co-developing” (“Digital\nHumanities and Academic Change”). But he also details the structures within and\naround which the digital humanities have developed, arguing that it has created only\nthe conditions for “evolutionary change” instead of “revolutionary change” (ibid).\n\nThe field has not produced enough of the “cultural criticism” that gives research\nin the humanities meaning and impact beyond the esoteric. Liu and several other\nscholars launched the advocacy site 4Humanities in November 2010, and it promises\nto provide proponents of the humanities with “a stockpile of digital tools, collabo-\nration methods, royalty-free designs and images, best practices, new-media exper-\ntise, and customizable newsfeeds of issues and events relevant to the state of the\nhumanities in any local or national context” (Liu, “Digital Humanities and Academic\nChange”). At current reading—admittedly early in the life of 4Humanities—the site\nis an irregularly updated group blog and index of digital humanities projects whose\nposts assert the value of the humanities and link to similar media. The stridency and\ngrandiosity of the 4Humanities mission statement is important and necessary, but\nthere does not seem to be a detailed plan at this stage for realizing the group’s goals.\n\nSuch plans are crucial, necessary, and incredibly difficult to implement. Too\nfew digital humanities projects take the extra steps to argue for their generalizable\nvalue or even to create the conditions for broad adoption. There are many expla-\nnations for this, not least of all the question of digital humanists’ responsibility for\nservice, which Liu addresses in his work and Bethany Nowviskie has also written\nabout (Nowviskie, “Eternal September of the Digital Humanities”).

There tends to be less effort given\nto the grinding and frustrating process of supporting a tool after it has been pro-\nduced. Such steps are necessary for building a user base, fixing bugs, and creating\nthe conditions for additional community development.*\n\nTake, for instance, the impressive Hypercities project, “a collaborative research\nand educational platform for traveling back in time to explore the historical layers\nof city spaces in an interactive, hypermedia environment” (Hypercities). Hypercities\nis funded by the MacArthur Foundation and is developed at the UCLA Center for\nthe Digital Humanities. The site allows visitors to drill down into geolocated his-\ntorical maps and to build multimedia collections on top. This is a fantastic resource\nfor humanities instruction at various levels, and yet there are obstacles that limit its\nimpact. At the time this essay is being written, more than two years after Hypercities\nwas launched, the documentation for the project is spotty, FAQs and forum pages\nare under construction, and the only content on a page labeled “Getting Started” is\nan eight-minute video that offers an overview of the platform but no explanation\nof how one can actually begin working on it. The site lists a handful of classes that\nare using Hypercities as of spring 2011, but each of those was taught by a researcher\nwho was personally involved in building the site.\n\nIt is not clear to what extent Hypercities is being used for teaching and learning\nbeyond the orbit of the Center for Digital Humanities at UCLA. Hypercities may\nvery well have plans for making more robust documentation and support for their\nyoung platform. But there is a feeling that projects like this, which embrace “per-\npetual beta” and focus more on delivering whiz-bang components than doing the\nless glamorous—and less recognized—work of outreach, community development,\nand support, especially around questions of pedagogy and curriculum develop-\nment. Yet those questions are perhaps just as important to securing and extending\nthe reach of innovations as the innovations themselves. It is in those moments of\nengagement with those who arer’t already part of the conversation where the val-\nues embedded in the individual digital humanities project become most general-\nized, accessible, and influential.\n\nPedagogy and curricula remain the best avenues to assert, protect, and energize\nthe role of the humanities in higher education, particularly via the general education\nprograms that, unfortunately, so few full-time faculty members get excited about\nteaching. These curricula are often expected to fulfill multiple goals, including intro-\nducing students to the college experience, providing remediation where needed,\ngiving students broad exposure to the humanities, and building broad informa-\ntion literacy. But in many cases, large general education courses are foisted upon\nadjuncts who are unsupported and who often don’t know how their courses fit in\nwith other parts of the curriculum. Yet it remains here where a college’s values are\nmost evident and here where ideas from the digital humanities can have the most\ntransformative impact.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:25 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n \n\f"

The 2011 Horizon Report identified digital media literacy as “a key skill in\nevery discipline and profession” and noted that while some colleges and universities\nare starting to integrate these skills into curricula, the progress is slow and uncoor-\ndinated (Johnson, Smith, Willis, Levine, and Haywood). A few programs and cen-\nters have emerged that attempt to do this via specific student projects, including\nMaryland’s Digital Cultures and Creativity Program, the University of California’s\nDigital Media and Learning Center, University of Virginia’s Digital Media Lab, and\nUniversity of North Carolina’s Media Resources Center.\n\nThe University of Mary Washington (UMW) has built an online publishing\nplatform-—-UMW Blogs—that has for five years pushed the school’s curriculum to\nembrace the opportunities of networked teaching and learning and the exploration\nof processes of digital identity formation. The platform emerged in large part due to\nthe inspiration of faculty member Gardner Campbell’s time on campus and the fer-\nvent experimentation of instructional technologist Jim Groom and his comrades at\nthe Division of Teaching and Learning Technologies. It has benefited from partner-\nships with several committed faculty members. Led by Jeffrey McClurken, a group\nof faculty and staff at UMW is now seeking to systematize what they have learned\nvia work on UMW Blogs in the form of a Digital Knowledge Initiative (DKI). This\nwould create a Digital Knowledge Center to support students who are looking to\nadapt new technologies into their learning and to help faculty members who are\nseeking to integrate digital work into their courses. A broader goal would be to\nfoster and institutionalize a college-wide conversation about teaching and learning\nwith digital tools and to develop curricula and support practices that would best\nequip students to critically produce, consume, and assess information during their\ncollege years and beyond.\n\nNew York City College of Technology’s current project—“A Living Laboratory:\nRedesigning General Education for a 21st Century College of Technology”—offers\nan exciting reconceptualization of the traditional general education curriculum.\nThis project has four connected goals: “a redesign of the college’s general education\ncurriculum to enrich connections between the courses taken by students through-\nout their four years at the college; the creation of a state-of-the-art digital platform\nfor teaching and learning; the integration of comprehensive outcomes assessment\ninto the curriculum; and the establishment of a restricted endowment to support\nthe new Center for the Study of the Brooklyn Waterfront” (Brooklyn Eagle). The\nimprint of the digital humanities is visible in this project, especially in its multi- and\ninterdisciplinarity, its reliance on open digital tools, and its emphasis on creating\nnew models of collaboration between students, faculty members, administrators,\nand the community around the college.

He is the\ndirector of the CUNY Academic Commons and a cofounder of the CUNY Digital\nHumanities Initiative and was also the project director of “Looking for Whitman:\nThe Poetry of Place in the Life and Work of Walt Whitman.” The last project was the\nbeneficiary of two Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants from the NEH’s ODH, and\n“A Living Laboratory” builds directly on both the structure and “place-based ped-\nagogy” explored in the Whitman experiment in a way that promises to transform\nwhat it means to teach and learn at City Tech (Looking for Whitman)?\n\nThe initiatives at both UMW and City Tech have emerged in deep dialogue with\ndevelopments in the digital humanities. Importantly, those dialogues have been led\nby individuals who also possess a deep sense of and long-standing commitment to\nthe particular missions and needs of each individual institution. Each project has\nthe potential to fundamentally alter the curriculum of the college and could also\nshift (for at least the medium term, if not longer) the labor structure that supports\ninstruction in the humanities on each campus. It is not coincidental that both UWM\nand CUNY have long traditions of support for experiential and radical pedagogy.\nSuch commitments are preconditions for work in the digital humanities to have a\ntruly transformative impact on a college’s humanities instruction.\n\nUltimately, of course, it shouldn’t be up to the digital humanities or any one\nfield to “fix” the problems in American higher education. Those problems are reflec-\ntive of much broader social and political conditions. Yet the digital humanities\ncan—and, indeed, is uniquely positioned to—invigorate arguments about why the\nhumanities matters, how it relates to our progress as a society, and why universities\nmust protect and promote it vigorously in the face of increased pressure to quan-\ntify its relevance. Participants in the digital humanities and the finding agencies\nthat support their work can learn from initiatives like those at UMW and City Tech\nthat tool production, iteration, conferences, and a few cluster hires here and there\nwill not dramatically alter the landscape of higher education. But more bridges that\nconnect the digital humanities to the myriad spaces the humanities occupy within\nthe structure of the academy just might. To really make a lasting impact on higher\neducation, digital humanists must give more systematic, consistent, resilient, mul-\ntilayered attention to the invisible, ugly stepchildren of the university.\n\nNOTES\n\n1.

But in the more pluralist sense of books one really needs to\nhave read to take part in the discipline? And of books many of us teach in common\nto our own students? Certainly. These are canons. They exist.\n\nSo why, a few decades after the question of canonicity as such was in any way\ncurrent, do we still have these things? If we all agree that canons are bad, why haven't\nwe done away with them? Why do we merely tinker around the edges, adding a\nMorrison here and subtracting a Dryden there? What are we going to do about this\nproblem? And more to the immediate point, what does any of this have to do with\ndigital humanities and with debates internal to digital work?\n\nThe Problem of Abundance\n\nThe answer to the question “Why do we still have canons?” is as simple to articulate\nas it is apparently difficult to solve. We don’t read any faster than we ever did, even\nas the quantity of text produced grows larger by the year.

Looking further back, British publishers were bring-\ning out more than a novel a week, on average, as early as the late eighteenth century\n(Moretti, 7, citing several studies); and American publishers managed the same feat\nby the mid-nineteenth century (Wright). So although the scale of the inadequacy\nof our reading is greater now than it was even a decade ago, the fact that we haven’t\nbeen able to keep up with contemporary literary production is nothing new. We've\nhad a version of the problem of abundance for centuries, whether we've cared to\nacknowledge it or not.\n\nAnother way of putting the issue would be to say that we need to decide what\nto ignore. And the answer with which we've contented ourselves for generations is,\n“Pretty much everything ever written.” Even when we read diligently, we don’t read\nvery much. What little we do read is deeply nonrepresentative of the full field of lit-\nerary and cultural production, as critics of our existing canons have rightly observed\nfor decades. In the contemporary case, we read largely those few books that are\nactively promoted by the major publishing houses and in any case almost exclusively\nbooks that have been vetted through commercial publication. When we try to do\nbetter, to be more inclusive or representative in both form and content, we do so\nboth with a deep set of ingrained cultural biases that are largely invisible to us and\n(because we've read so little) in ignorance of their alternatives. This is to say that we\ndon’t really have any firm sense of how we would even try to set about fixing our can-\nons, because we have no idea how they're currently skewed. We're doing little better,\nfrankly, than we were with the dead white male bunch fifty or a hundred years ago,\nand we're just as smug in our false sense of intellectual scope. The problem, more-\nover, is getting worse as the store of unread books grows with each passing week.\n\nSo canons—even in their current, mildly multiculturalist form—are an enor-\nmous problem, one that follows from our single working method as literary\nscholars—that is, from the need to perform always and only close reading as a\nmeans of cultural analysis. It’s probably clear where ’'m going with this, at least to\nsome of those who work in digital literary studies. We need. to do less close reading\nand more of anything and everything else that might help us extract information\nfrom and about texts as indicators of larger cultural issues. That includes biblio-\nmetrics and book historical work, data mining and quantitative text analysis, eco-\nnomic study of the book trade and of other cultural industries, geospatial analysis,\nand so on. Franco Moretti’s work is an obvious model here, as is that of people like\n\n \n\nMichael Witmore on early modern drama and Nicholas Dames on social structures\nin nineteenth-century fiction.\n\nExample: Text Extraction and Mapping\n\nOne example of what I have in mind is shown in Figure 14.2, which presents a\nmap of the locations mentioned in a corpus of thirty-seven American literary texts\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:56:02 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n[251\n\f"

For one thing, we'll almost certainly become\nworse close readers. Our time is finite; the less of it we devote to an activity, the less\nwe'll develop our skill in that area. Exactly how much our reading suffers and how\nmutch we should care are matters of reasonable debate; they depend on both the\nextent of the shift and the shape of the skill-experience curve for close reading. My\nsense is that we'll come out all right and that it’s a trade—a few more numbers in\nreturn for a bit less text-—well worth making. We gain a lot by having available to us\nthe kinds of evidence text mining (for example) provides, enough that the outcome\nwill almost certainly be a net positive for the field. But ’'m willing to admit that the\nproof will be in the practice and that the practice is, while promising, as yet pretty\nlimited. The important point, though, is that the decay of close reading as such is\na negative in itself only if we mistakenly equate literary and cultural analysis with\ntheir current working method.\n\nSecond—and here’s the heart of the debate for those of us already engaged\nin digital projects of one sort or another—we'll need to see a related reallocation\nof resources within DH itself. Over the last couple of decades, many of our most\nvisible projects have been organized around canonical texts, authors, and cultural\nartifacts. They have been motivated by a desire to understand those (quite limited)\nobjects more robustly and completely, on a model plainly derived from conven-\ntional humanities scholarship. That wasn’t a mistake, nor are those projects without\nsignificant value. They’ve contributed to our understanding of, for example, Ros-\nsetti and Whitman, Stowe and Dickinson, Shakespeare and Spenser. And they've\nhelped legitimate digital work in the eyes of suspicious colleagues by showing how\nfar we can extend our traditional scholarship with new technologies. They've pro-\nvided scholars around the world—including those outside the centers of university\npower-—with improved access to rare materials and improved pedagogy by the same\nmeans. But we shouldit ignore the fact that they've also often been large, expen-\nsive undertakings built on the assumption that we already know which authors and\ntexts are the ones to which we should devote our scarce resources. And to the extent\nthat they've succeeded, they've also reinforced the canonicity of their subjects by\nincreasing the amount of critical attention paid to them.\n\nWhat's required for computational and. quantitative work—the kind of work\nthat undermines rather than reinforces canons—is more material, less elaborately\ndeveloped.

None\nof these projects are cheap. But on a per-volume basis, they're very affordable, largely\nbecause they avoid extensive human intervention (via detailed markup, for exam-\nple) in the preparation of the texts. And of course the Google and Hathi corpora\nwere produced with remarkably limited direct costs to the academic departments\nthat will use them, particularly in light of their magnitude.

            "result": "202 |\n\n \n\nDisability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities\n\nGEORGE H. WILLIAMS\n\nver the last several decades, scholars have developed standards for how best\nto create, organize, present, and preserve digital information so that future\n\n \n\ngenerations of teachers, students, scholars, and librarians may still use it.\nWhat has remained neglected for the most part, however, are the needs of people\nwith disabilities. As a result, many of the otherwise most valuable digital resources\nare useless for people who are—for example—deaf or hard of hearing, as well as\nfor people who are blind, have low vision, or have difficulty distinguishing particu-\nlar colors. While professionals working in educational technology and commercial\nweb design have made significant progress in meeting the needs of such users, the\nhumanities scholars creating digital projects all too often fail to take these needs\ninto account. This situation would be much improved if more projects embraced\nthe concept of universal design, the idea that we should always keep the largest pos-\nsible audience in mind as we make design decisions, ensuring that our final product\nserves the needs of those with disabilities as well as those without.\n\nIt is imperative that digital humanities work take into account the important\ninsights of disability studies in the humanities, an interdisciplinary field that con-\nsiders disability “not so much a property of bodies as a product of cultural rules\nabout what bodies should be or do,” in the words of Rosemarie Garland-Thomson,\na prominent figure in the field (6). Digital knowledge tools that assume everyone\napproaches information with the same abilities and using the same methods risk\nexcluding a large percentage of people. In fact, such tools actually do the work of dis-\nabling people by preventing them from using digital resources altogether. We must\nbroaden our understanding of the ways in which people use digital resources. For\nexample, visually impaired people take advantage of digital technologies for “acces-\nsibility,” technologies that (with their oral/aural and tactile interfaces) are fascinat-\ningly different than the standard screen-keyboard-mouse combination, forcing us\nto rethink our embodied relationship to data. Learning to create scholarly digital\narchives that take into account these human differences is a necessary task no one\nhas yet undertaken.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:53 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

            "result": "Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities\n\nIn what follows I consider the somewhat arbitrary concept of disability and\nassistive technology, argue why the digital humanities community should adopt a\nuniversal design approach, explain what a universal design approach would look\nlike, and then offer a few specific suggestions for collaborative projects that should\nbe undertaken by digital humanists.\n\nQuestioning Disability\n\nL first became interested in these issues as a graduate student working with Garland-\nThomson when she was a faculty fellow at the Maryland Institute for Technology\nin the Humanities (MITH) in the fall of 2001. During this experience, 1 was forced\nto reevaluate my assumptions about using computers and designing web pages.\nGarland-Thomson worked with the staff at MITH to create an online academic\nresource site for disability studies, and we decided to design the website with maxi-\nmum accessibility. To do so, we needed to think about the needs of people who are\nblind, have low vision, or have difficulty navigating because of the clutter that often\naccumulates on web pages. (We had no plans to include audio, so addressing the\nneeds of people who are deaf or hard of hearing was not in our plan.) At the same\ntime, we aimed for a visual design that would appeal to sighted users. We kept the\nlayout simple and added certain features specifically for certain kinds of users. For\nexample, because tech-savvy blind people often have their computer read websites\nout loud using what is known as screen-reading software, many find it tedious to\nlisten to the identical detailed navigation menu on every page within a given site. To\nsolve this problem, we inserted a tiny image—a transparent GIF exactly one pixel\nsquare, to be exact-—at the beginning of each page with an alt attribute that read,\n“Skip to main content.” This image would be invisible to sighted users, but those\nlistening to the page with screen-reading software—which reads aloud the alt attri-\nbutes of images embedded in an HTML page—could use that GIF as their cue to\njump past what they did not need to hear in order to get to the information that\nthey did want to hear. We also made sure that every image tag had an alt attribute\nwhere necessary, although in general we kept images to a minimum. For advice on\naccessibility issues, we worked with a blind person who used. screen-reading soft-\nware to listen to the web, rather than reading it off of a visual display as a sighted\nperson would do. She demonstrated this software for me, and I was surprised by\nhow quickly the words were spoken by the synthesized voice that came from her\nlaptop’s speakers. In fact, I could not understand anything at all that she was doing.\nTo accommodate me, she adjusted the settings to slow down significantly the syn-\nthesized speech, at which point I could understand the words but still found myself\nunable to orient myself on a given page or within a given website. This scenario\ncaused me to reevaluate my understanding of what it means to be disabled, as she\nclearly was using abilities that 1 did not—and still do not—have: J had not trained\nmyself to be able to process auditory information as efficiently as she could.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:53 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 203\n\f"

            "result": "204 |\n\nGEORGE H. WILLIAMS\n\nWalter Ong famously wrote, “Technologies are artificial, but . . . artificiality is\nnatural to humans” (81). Ong’s concern is with writing as a fundamentally artificial\nprocess that has been so “internalized” by humans that it appears to be as natural to\nus as talking. Ong’s observation is part of a larger cultural critique that highlights\nthe socially constructed nature of the ways we perceive technology and its role in\nour lives. To those of us who are more or less comfortable with the existing domi-\nnant model of using computers, anything different, like a fast screen reader, seems\nalien, and the potential shortcomings of our familiar model of some combination\nof keyboard, mouse, and visual display remain invisible to us. We classify some soft-\nware and hardware tools as “assistive technology”—-sometimes the term “adaptive\ntechnology” is used. instead—because they have been designed specifically to assist\nthose people with “special needs.” We might consider, however, that there is no “nat-\nural” way to interact with the 1’s and 0’s that make up the data we are interested in\ncreating, transmitting, receiving, and using; there is only the model we have chosen\nto think of as natural. All technology is assistive, in the end.\n\nFinally, we would do weil to be aware of the range of “assistive”-technology soft-\nware applications and hardware devices that do not work in the same ways as the\ndevices used by nondisabled people. In addition to being compatible with desktop\ncomputers, laptops, smart phones, and tablet devices, the materials we create should\nalso work well with such tools as refreshable braille displays, digital talking book\ndevices, screen reader applications, and screen magnification software.\n\nUniversal Design Defined\n\nThe term “universal design” was invented by architect Ronald Mace, founder of\nNorth Carolina State University’s (NCSU) Center for Universal Design. Accord-\ning to the NCSU College of Design, the term “describe[s] the concept of designing\nall products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest\nextent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life” (“Ron-\nald L. Mace”). Wendy Chisolm and Matt May write that to embrace universal design\nprinciples is to “approach every problem .. . with the ultimate goal of providing\nthe greatest benefit to the greatest number of people possible” (2). Mace argues for\nthe importance of distinguishing between universal design principles and accessi-\nbility principles. To embrace accessibility is to focus design efforts on people who\nare disabled, ensuring that all barriers have been removed. To embrace universal\ndesign, by contrast, is to focus “not specifically on people with disabilities, but all\npeople” (Mace). Something created to assist a person with a disability—to make\ntheir environment more accessible in some way-——might not be affordable or aes-\nthetically pleasing even if it is usable and helpful. Something created using universal\ndesign principles, on the other hand, is designed “for a very broad definition of user\nthat encourages attractive, marketable products that are more usable by everyone”\n(Mace). Devoting efforts to accessibility might improve the built environment for\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:53 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

Mace cites the example of the automatic garage door opener\nas a consumer product created with universal design principles: it is affordable; it\nappeals to and is useful to people both with and without disabilities. Another fre-\nquently cited example of universal design is the sidewalk curb cut; initially created\nto allow people in wheelchairs to cross the street more easily, curb cuts became rec-\nognized as useful also to other people such as someone making a delivery with a\ndolly, a traveler pulling luggage on wheels, a parent pushing a child in a stroller, or a\nperson walking beside their bicycle. Whether in a physical or a digital environment,\ndesigners are always making choices about accessibility. However, not all designers\nare aware of how their choices affect accessibility. Universal design is design that\ninvolves conscious decisions about accessibility for all, and it is a philosophy that\nshould be adopted more widely by digital humanities scholars.\n\nWhy Universal Design?\n\nBefore I recommend how to adopt universal design principles, I need to explain the\nseveral reasons why we should do so. First, ensuring that digital resources created\nwith federal funding are accessible is the law in many countries. In the United States,\nfor example, the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was amended in 1998 with what\nis now referred to as Section 508 to require that all federal agencies “developing,\nprocuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology” ensure\nthat disabled people “have access to and use of information and data that is com-\nparable to the access to and use of the information and data” by people who are not\ndisabled (U.S. General Services Administration, “Section 508 of the Rehabilitation\nAct, as Amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.”), American govern-\nment agencies that fund digital humanities projects do not currently require proof\nof accessibility, but there is no reason to assume that this will always be the case. In\naddition to the United States, the list of nations with laws or policies requiring web\naccessibility includes Australia, Canada, Germany, Israel, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan,\nKorea, Portugal, and Spain (Chisolm and May, 14~15). At some point in the future,\nproject directors seeking government funding could be turned down if they are\nunable to demonstrate in their grant proposals that the results of their work will be\naccessible. Rather than wait until such time at which the laws begin to be enforced,\nwe should start now to follow the existing guidelines for accessibility and to develop\nour own guidelines and tools for authoring and evaluating accessible resources. Not\nall digital humanities projects are created with government funding, of course, but\nenough of them are that this is a significant issue. Furthermore, instructors who\nwish to use digital humanities resources in their courses will need to ensure that\nthose resources are accessible if they teach at an institution that receives any sort of\ngovernment funding. Otherwise, they make themselves and their institution vul-\nnerable to legal action.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:53 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 205\n\f"

In order to adhere to the “alternative means\nof access” subsection of Section 508, American web designers used to create alter-\nnative, accessible versions of their content to parallel the original content. However,\ncoding everything twice—first for nondisabled people and then again for disabled\npeople—is time consuming and expensive. Fortunately, web standards have devel-\noped enough that this duplication of effort is no longer necessary. Instead, it is now\npossible to create just one version of a resource and to make design choices that\nensure the resource suits the needs of all users, disabled and nondisabled alike. The\nability to separate structure from presentation is particularly useful in this regard.\n\nThird, applying universal design principles to digital resources will make those\nresources more likely to be compatible with multiple devices. To create an online\nresource that only works with a desktop or laptop computer is to exclude people\nwho would prefer to access the resource with a smart phone, a tablet, or some other\nmobile device. The Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium\npoints out that there is “significant overlap between making a website accessible for\na mobile device and for people with disabilities” (Henry, “Web Content Accessibil-\nity”). Compatibility with mobile devices is important because an increasing number\nof people are using such devices to access the web. In the United States, for exam-\nple, young adults between the ages of eighteen and thirty-three make up the largest\nsegment of the population of web users at 35 percent (Zickuhr, 4), and 65 percent\nof those between the ages of eighteen and twenty-nine use a mobile device to go\nonline (Smith, 5). Furthermore, those more likely to use a mobile device for online\naccess include African Americans, Hispanics, and individuals from lower-income\nhouseholds (Smith, 10). If the digital humanities is to create resources accessible\nby a diverse array of people, then compatibility with mobile devices is a necessity.\n\nFourth and finally, it is the right thing to do. We recognize the importance of\nopen access for scholarly materials, but “open access means more than simply mak-\ning stuff available,” as Jeremy Boggs, humanities design architect at the University of\nVirginia’s Scholars’ Lab, has said. We would never use a proprietary format for pre-\nserving and sharing our work, in part because to do so would be to exclude those\npeople who cannot afford or do not have access to the necessary software to use that\nformat. However, few of us think twice about whether or not the format we have\nchosen and the design choices we have made exclude disabled people. It might be\ntempting to assume that few, ifany, disabled people are interested in or need to make\nuse of our work, but by creating barriers to access we are ensuring that such people\nwill never have the opportunity to participate in the digital humanities. According\nto a report from the Pew Research Center’s Internet and American Life Project, 81\npercent of all adults report using the Internet, but only 54 percent of disabled adults\ndo (Fox, “Americans,” 3). Of course, disabled adults are also more likely to be older,\nto have lower incomes, and to have less education than nondisabled adults, and all\nof these demographic factors are correlated with lower levels of Internet use (Fox,\n“What People”). However, inaccessible design choices remain a significant barrier\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:53 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

If our goals include the ability to share our work with as wide and diverse an\naudience as possible, then we should embrace universal design principles.\n\nDesigning for Accessibility\n\nItis beyond the scope of this chapter to reiterate the specific guidelines for design-\ning accessible web resources, especially when so many useful guidelines already\nexist. Digital humanists interested in learning more about these guidelines would\ndo well to start with the Web Accessibility Initiative website hosted by the World\nWide Web Consortium, where they will find a wide variety of specific recommen-\ndations as well as references to additional resources. Many helpful tutorials may\nbe found on other sites, of course, but the Web Accessibility Initiative guidelines\nspecifically and the World Wide Web Consortium guidelines more generally are\nwidely considered to be web standards followed by those who create and main-\ntain web-based resources. There are, however, specific projects that the digital\nhumanities community should undertake in order to improve greatly the acces-\nsibility of the resources we create as well as the ease with which we make those\nresources accessible.\n\nSpecific Project Ideas\n\nACCESSIBILITY TOGLS FOR CONTENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS\n\nAccessibility would be much easier for most content creators to achieve if a suite of\nfree and open-source accessibility tools were developed for popular content man-\nagement systems (CMS). A list of the most commonly used CMSes for digital\nhumanities projects would include—but not be limited to—WordPress, Drupal,\nOmeka, MediaWiki, and Joomla. Each of these has a number of appealing features:\nthey are relatively easy to install, often available as one-click-installation options\nthrough commercial web-hosting services; they are free and open-source projects;\nand their appearance and functions may be customized through the use of such\nadd-ons as themes, plug-ins, modules, and extensions. A valuable project would be\nfor the digital humanities community to develop a collection of add-ons that would\nintegrate easily with these CMSes and improve the accessibility of the websites they\ndeliver. Making available a ready-made set of accessibility tools for developers to\nadd to their sites would allow individual projects to avoid the work of develop-\ning and evaluating their own accessibility features independently of one another.\nThese tools could not only provide end users with a more accessible interface but\nalso provide content creators with built-in accessibility evaluation functions, facili-\ntating good design choices from the ground up rather than after a site has already\nbeen completed.\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:53 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\n| 207\n\f"

WILLIAMS\n\nFORMAT TRANSLATION TOOLS\n\nIn July of 2010, the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University\nhosted a workshop involving twelve digital humanists who were tasked with creat-\ning a useful digital humanities tool in one week. The result was Anthologize, “a free,\nopen-source plugin that transforms WordPress 3.0 into a platform for publishing\nelectronic texts” “About,” Anthologize). Anthologize imports texts from RSS feeds\nand then translates them into one of a handful of alternate formats: ePub, PDE,\nTEI (plus HTML), or RTE Blind people who use the web are in need of a digital\nhumanities project that either extends Anthologize or creates a similar tool so that\nRSS feeds may be converted easily and automatically into XML formats that work\nwith digital talking book devices or with braille output devices.\n\nA digital talking book is an XML document created to be compatible with any\nof a number of devices that will read the document aloud. The format includes\nmetadata that facilitates navigation between different sections of the document,\nand it may include recordings of a person reading the document aloud, or it may be\ndesigned to be read aloud as synthesized speech by a device (“ANSI/NISO Z39.86”).\nSince 1996, the DAISY Consortium has been working to establish and promote an\n\n \n\nopen standard for digital talking books (About Us”). One of their most powerful\nproducts is the DAISY Pipeline, “a cross-platform, open source framework for DTB-\nrelated document transformations” (“DAISY Pipeline”). A well-structured docu-\nment in a format like TEI or HTML is ideally suited to be automatically translated\ninto the DAISY format through a software process that makes use of the DAISY\nPipeline. A CMS add-on like Anthologize that accomplishes this task efficiently,\nautomatically, and easily would be an extremely powerful tool in the hands of con-\ntent creators, allowing them to easily make their texts available as digital talking\nbooks, providing access to information for the many people who make use of digi-\ntal talking books as their primary method of reading.\n\nPeopie literate in braille often prefer to read by that method rather than by lis-\ntening to texts. Reading content through braille provides a deeper understanding\nof that content for many, yet producing well-formatted braille files is accomplished\nthrough one of two expensive methods.’ First, professionals who are certified braille\ntranslators may be hired to create well-formatted braille. Second, a number of com-\nmercial braille translation software applications may be used; the most reliable\napplications cost several hundred dollars and are cost prohibitive to low-income\nusers and nonspecialized content creators. A CMS add-on like Anthologize could\nbe such a translator if it incorporated Liblouis, a widely used open-source braille\ntranslation engine. Such an add-on would allow braille readers to access online texts\nthrough such devices as refreshable braille displays or braille embossers.

These individuals benefit from online\ncaptioning as well as from written transcriptions presented as separate and inde-\npendent documents. Creating captions and transcriptions makes such information\nsubject to search and computer analysis in ways not currently possible with audio\nand video alone. Additionally, individuals without disabilities often find transcrip-\ntions easier to follow. The time and expense of captioning or transcribing is a sig-\nnificant obstacle to making accessible an online project featuring several hours of\nvideo or audio. Currently, a number of desktop software applications provide an\ninterface designed to facilitate captioning videos or transcribing audio. However,\nnone of them that I have found are free, and because they are not online tools none\nof them allow projects to take advantage of one of the web’s most powerful and rel-\natively new practices: crowdsourcing.\n\n“Crowdsourcing” is a term coined by Jeff Howe in 2006 to describe online proj-\nects that make use of free or extremely inexpensive labor provided by “enthusiasts”\naround the world who are interested in donating their time to a project that inter-\nests them. Several digital humanities projects have experimented with taking this\napproach to transcribing digital images of documents, with mixed results: nonexpert\ntranscribers sometimes make a significant number of mistakes when transcribing\nmaterial written in an unfamiliar hand (Cohen). However, a digital file in which the\naudio has been clearly recorded stands to result in a more accurate transcription, even\nby nonexpert transcribers. The Center for History and New Media is currently devel-\noping a promising online tool named Scripto, which “will allow users to contribute\ntranscriptions to online documentary projects” (“About,” Scripto). Transcriptions of\nimages of documents greatly enhance accessibility for people who are blind because\nscreen readers will be able to read aloud the transcriptions while image-only docu-\nmenits are inaccessible. People who are deaf or hard of hearing, however, are in need\nof a digital humanities project that presents a user-friendly interface like Scripto for\nhearing people to caption videos or transcribe audio. Universal Subtitles, created by\nthe Participatory Culture Foundation, is an admirable example of such an interface\n(“Frequently Asked Questions”).

However, by working to meet the needs of disabled\npeople—and by working with disabled people through usability testing—the digi-\ntal humanities community will also benefit significantly as it rethinks its assump-\ntions about how digital devices could and should work with and for people. Gra-\nham Pullin, a senior lecturer in the University of Dundee School of Computing, has\nobserved that the prevailing assumption in product design is that new developments\nin the mainstream slowly “trickle-down” to “specialist products for people with dis-\nabilities” (xiii). However, as Pullin points out, sometimes the effect works the other\nway, “when the issues around disability catalyze new design thinking and influence\na broader design culture in return” Oxii). What I am arguing is that infusing the\ndigital humanities with universal design principles will result in just this kind of\nreciprocal relationship.\n\nMatthew Kirschenbaum has described “the current state of new media stud-\n\n \n\nies” as one “in which the graphical user interface is often uncritically accepted as\nthe ground zero of the user’s experience” (34). In arguing that computer storage\ndeserves more critical attention from scholars than it has traditionally received,\nKirschenbaum adopts Nick Montfort’s term “screen essentialism” to describe the\nfallacy of assuming that all computer interaction occurs through the interface of the\nscreen. Montfort points out that screen essentialism obscures the diversity of com-\nputing interfaces that have existed prior to the appearance of the modern electronic\nscreen; in particular, as he describes, early computing programs relied on paper\ninterfaces. Montfort’s point is historical, but screen essentialism also obscures the\ndiversity of contemporary interfaces used by people with disabilities and, increas-\ningly, by all people.\n\nBlind computer users, for example, have no use for a screen, and they most\noften use an interface that is either tactile, in the form of refreshable braille devices,\nor audible, in the form of screen-reading software or digital books. We might also\nreconsider our “essentialist” thinking about the keyboard and the mouse and not\njust because of the technologies that we perceive to be specific to disabled people.\nSpeech recognition technologies, while far from perfect, are already accurate enough\nto allow writers—if that is still the correct term—to compose documents without\n\n \n\nthe need for typing. And the growth of touch screens, primarily but not exclusively\navailable on mobile devices, bring the possibility of a mouse-less future ever closer.\nBoth of these technologies are extremely useful for people who are disabled, but\n\nThis content downloaded from\n131.130.169.6 on Sun, 61 Nov 2020 18:55:53 UTC\nAll use subject to https://about jstor.org/terms\n\f"

These infrastructures will be like the disastrously wrongly planned\nand developed highways that connect nothing to nowhere.!\n\nThere are many directions from which we can approach the question of why\nbig all-encompassing all-serving digital infrastructures are meaningless and\nuseless for digital humanities technology development. In fact there are so\nmany aspects to consider that making the argument is hard, making it akin to\nthat feeling of the whole thing being so wrong on so many levels and convo-\nluted in so many ways that it is hard to figure out where to start explaining. I\nwill narrow my argument to what I can say on the subject based on the expe-\nrience and knowledge on innovation of technology and methodology for digital\nscholarly editions that | accumulated during the past five years running the\nInteredition initiative (Interedition 2012). This knowledge touches, amongst\nother themes, upon processes of innovation, changing research practices, soft-\nware development and sustainability. Although this knowledge and experience\npredominantly pertains to the creation, functioning, analysis and preservation\nof digital scholarly editions and related tools and data, I do think the argument,\nmutatis mutandis, applies to the relationship between big digital infrastructures\nand the majority of digital scholarship in the humanities.\n\nThe Innovation Aspect\n\nGiven recent large investments in projects such as BAMBOO (<http://www.\nprojectbamboo.org/>), DARIAH (<http:/Avww.dariah.eu/>), and CLARIN\n(<http://www.clarin.eu/external/>), there seems to be a certain consensus\namong funders and policymakers that there is a real need for the humanities to\nshift its methodology into the digital realm. The report of the American Coun-\ncil of Learned Societies Commission on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities\nand Social Sciences, for example, heralds digital and computational approaches\nas drivers of methodological innovation in humanities. Development programs\non which large-scale infrastructure projects like BAMBOO, DARIAH, and\nCLARIN are based adopt similar policies, terming the humanities as inherently\ntoo conservative to adopt an innovative digital methodology. It is also routine\nto point out a lack of proper formalization for the field, due to the ephemeral\nand heterogeneous nature of humanities research. Furthermore, there is an\nabsence of a critical mass of digitized research data. Insufficient IT training and\nskills are furthermore to blame. (Welshons 2006) In all, true digital methodo-\nlogical innovation will not happen without considerable additional impulses to\ndevelop tools and infrastructure.\n\n' For a particular daunting example of real world infrastructure planning failure, see\n<http://www.baltimorebrew.com/201 1/02/) /highway-to-nowhere-shut-down-and-\nbaltimore-doesnt-notice/>.\n\n166\n\f"

These large infrastructures promise to deliver a shared digital infrastruc-\nture to store and sustain research data in such ways that the data will be unique-\nly identified, discoverable and usable. Appropriate tools to curate, discover,\nanalyze and visualize research data will be developed, maintained, and made\nusable for humanities scholars. These tools will be generalized and intuitive\nand will thus usher in the innovation of methodology by making pattern min-\ning, mass data analysis, and visualization of the future mass of digitized hu-\nmanities data tractable for the typical humanities researcher (Clariah 2012).\n\nBut if methodological innovation based on information technology is the\nkey to the future of the field, do big structures, either organizational or digital,\nform the right incubator pattern? First of all one must critically assess whether\na revolutionary paradigm shift must necessarily be tied to a shift towards the\ndigital. The primary purpose of digital technology is not to shift paradigms.\nRather, digital technology is most often simply used to enlarge the efficiency of\nexisting processes, for instance through automation (Haentjens Dekker 2011)\nand distribution of workload (Beaulieu 2012). And although computational\ntools may well add to a methodology, they should also warrant that existing\nheuristics and hermeneutics are appropriately translated into their equivalent\ndigital counterparts, especially in a field where heterogeneity of data and multi-\nfaceted approaches are not regarded as reducible noise but as essential proper-\nties of the research domain. The focus of the big infrastructures under devel-\nopment on a revolutionary paradigm shift and on large scale generalized tools\nand data seems at odds at least with the precautionary principle of ‘first do no\nharm’. What is perceived as a conservatism in a field may actually be the justi-\nfiable argument that IT has not produced very usable or even useful tools for\nhumanities scholars until now (Van Zundert 2012; Gray 2010, 47). Further-\nmore, given that the library world is now digitizing on a massive scale (KB\n2010), it is maybe not the critical mass of digitized data that is missing ~\nthough it is debatable enough whether the quality of its web availability is\nappropriate ~ but rather the tools that would allow humanities scholars to use\nthose digitized materials in any useful way for research.\n\nIt is unlikely that the large scale digital infrastructure projects will soive this\nproblem of lack of tools any time soon, just by being infrastructures of impres-\nsive scale. Mass data analysis tools have not been developed through big digital\ninfrastructures until now, but through industry and local university effort.\nMoreover as Gregory Crane puts it: “[djocument analysis, multilingual tech-\nnology, and information extraction can be modeled in general terms, but these\ntechnologies acquire meaning when they are aligned with the needs of particu-\nlar domains” (Crane 2006). Aligning with the needs of particular domains\nmeans adapting and applying general model digital tools, or even developing\npurpose built tools, to very specific domain constraints problems.

As Ramsay\npoints out, writing a blog post is essentially not a methodological innovation,\njust as using email or a text editor cannot be really called a leap of innovation.\nApplication of conventional interpretative frameworks to digitally born culture,\nsuch as a critical examination of online literary reception (Boot 2011), borders\non innovation in the sense that it broadens the field of study. But such research\nis not innovative in the sense that heuristics change or are renewed. Tool build-\ning in itself certainly does not necessarily constitute mnovation. A bibliography\nis a bibliography. The fact that it is digital does not represent innovation in\nitself, though it is of course highly useful and convenient to finally have such\nresources digitally available.\n\nThe expression of heuristics through tools and addition of new heuristics or\nsupport for interpretation through construction of models and analytical tools\ndoes constitute an act of innovation (Rockwell 2012). But such developments\nare exceptional. Of course there are examples past and present; we can point to\nnetwork analysis of correspondences (<http://ckec.huygens.knaw.nl/>) or au-\ntomated collation (Haentjens Dekker 2011) as projects that truly do touch upon\nnew heuristics. But all in all, real innovation, i.e. methodology changing inno-\nvation, based on information technology or computational approaches seems to\nbe rather scarce in the humanities. The larger part of digital humanities seems\nmore concerned with digitization, perhaps, than with methodological change.\nTrue innovation is a niche in a niche within digital humanities. To support and\nfoster that with large scale infrastructure seems excessive.\n\nThe Generalization Paradox\n\nDigitization is a well-tried and tested terrain for activities meant to generate\ndigital resources for humanities research. To a certain extent the types of\nworkflows, tasks, and technical properties involved in the digitization of re-\nsearch material are well known. There is an argument, therefore, that large\nscale digital infrastructure facilities are useful for supporting library institutions\nin digitizing, and that their common infrastructure serves as a natural host for\ndigitized data in order to expose it for use. However, the technical and support\nneeds vary so much from library to library institution that they do not seem\neasily generalizable. Moreover, a considerable number of libraries are digitiz-\ning or even already have digitized their collections, apparently without the help\n\n168\n\f"

The Circulation of Knowledge project executed at the\nHuygens ING in the Netherlands can be held up as just one example of how\nvolatile innovative projects can be. Its key objective is the development of tools\nto trace the evolution of ideas and concepts over time in learned correspon-\ndences from the time of the Dutch Republic. This requires, for example, push-\ning the state of the art of topic modeling over multiple languages barriers and\nphases. In the original project plan several technologies such as LSA\n(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis>) | and § Emdross\n(<http://emdros.org/>) were regarded as key technologies to implement the\nwish for temporal cross-language topic modeling. Meanwhile the combined\nexpertise of humanities and information technology researchers has moved the\nresearch team through several possible IT solutions. Among these several dead\nends are most of the technologies initially considered key. Leaps of progress\nare seldom and expensive. Investigation of many unknown paths, of the capa-\nbilities of new algorithmic possibilities, is essential to making progress. This\nhighly explorative way of innovation and development was only possible due\nto the explicit labeling of the project as ‘high risk’. It would be all too easy to\npoint to naive planning, overoptimistic estimation of the potential of the tech-\nnological state of the art, and maybe even to plain bad research. Yet far from\nbeing a haphazard experiment, this was a well-planned and executed mid-sized\nexternal investment proposal, put through the highest quality assessment crite-\nria of the Netherlands Scientific Organization and subsequently nationally and\ninternationally peer reviewed, and approved with the highest ratings. So ac-\ncording to all the people that should have been able to know, there was nothing\nwrong with the plan as initially presented.

A ‘one size fits all”\napproach would be a disastrous underestimation of the specific needs of hu-\nmianities research. The essence of humanities research is in its diverse, hetero-\ngeneous and ephemeral nature.

But the same paradox of generalization also applies to standards: the exact\npurpose and need of explorative research is to go beyond what is within the\nstandard. So if a generalized digital infrastructure is to serve any meaningful\nhumanities research it cannot be entirely governed by standards. Declaring that\n“we will use a standard” is to declare what exactly? That any data or tool not\nmatching that standard will be rejected on these infrastructures? If so, these are\ngoing to be mightily empty infrastructures. If an infrastructure really wants to\ncater to the needs of its users, the only realistic options are to either make room\nfor diversity within a standard — this is basically what the TEI has done by\nallowing arbitrary definitions to be appended via customization to a de facto\nstandard for text encoding — or to make room for any number of standards that\nmay be used for the same purpose on an infrastructure. The latter is what\nCLARIN proposes through its ISOCat system. However, both these solutions\nare counterproductive for generalization. The TEI for example ~ carefully\ncalling its definitions both a standard and a ‘set of guidelines’ (cf. <http://www.\ntei-c.org/>) ~ is arguably the most successful standard in its subfield of digital\nhumanities, if not in the whole of digital humanities. But the catch-all strategy\nof the TET means that it caters for the needs of specific text encoding by expli-\ncitly allowing any encoding. That in any case defies the purpose of generaliza-\nbility of the standard. To quote from the final report of the MONK project:\nOne of the declared goals of the Text Encoding Initiative has been to create\ndigitally encoded texts that are ‘machine-actionable’ in the sense of allowing a\nmachine to process the differences that human readers negotiate effortlessly in\nmoving from a paragraph, stanza, scene etc. in one book to a similar instance\nin another. American university libraries have developed a six-level hierarchy\nof encoding texts that is theoretically interoperable, but as we discovered very\nearly in MONK, in practice these texts do not actually interoperate. Encoding\nprojects at Virginia, Michigan, North Carolina, and Indiana certainly share\nfamily resemblances, but it is also obvious that in the design of these projects\nlocal preferences or convenience always took precedence over ensuring that\n‘my texts’ will play nicely with ‘your texts’. And aside from simple interope-\nrability, there is even less affordance for extensibility: none of the archives se-\nriously considered the possibility that some third party might want to tokenize\nor linguistically annotate their texts (Monk 2009, 4-5).\n\nA similar effect undermines the [SOcat system devised by CLARIN. The ISO-\ncat system describes itself as a data category registry, “Defining widely ac-\ncepted linguistic concepts” (<http://www.isocat.org/>). Once accepted, the\nstandard described within [SOcat will be usable on CLARIN infrastructure; the\nintent is to gather standards until a domain (in this case the linguistics domain)\nis sufficiently covered. Governance of standard acceptance is through a Deci-\nsion Group that is composed of a Thematic Domain Group and the Data Cate-\ngory Registry Board (cf. Fig. 2).\n\n \n\f"

But as we have seen, innovative tools and method-\nology sprout in a realm of relative uncertainty of technology and requirements.\nThis is precisely the opposite of what big infrastructures are likely to support.\nThe quick technology shifts and development of thinking that research innova-\ntion requires cannot be supported through these large unified infrastructures. In\nthis sense, large standards-based infrastructures will necessarily be intellectu-\nally prohibitive places: they do not allow the conception of new ideas, new\napproaches, or new models, as these do not fit the required infrastructural\nmold. What fits in the box, fits in the box, but out of the box thinking is an\nunsupported feature.\n\nThe opposition between the wish for efficient development and support of\nlarge controlled infrastructures for sharing unified resources on the one hand,\nand the need for quick and flexible short-lived solutions developed along evo-\nlutionary lines on the other hand, are by no means unique to digital humanities.\nThe problem of tension between innovation and consolidation in fact has\nsparked entire theories of management (Poppendieck 2009) and software de-\nvelopment processes (Beck 1999). As large industry IT development projects\nran aground more and more in the late nineties and early years of the new mil-\nlennium, it became clear that something was wrong with the waterfall type of\nmonitoring, control and risk management in many cases of software develop-\nment. A group of software developers decided to adopt a different approach to\nsoftware engineering and infrastructure development which resulted in the so\ncalled Agile Process (Fowler 2012) methodology. As with any new movement,\nvarious sub-factions arose, some more dogmatic than others.

A sprint begins with a discus-\nsion between researcher and developers on what needs to be developed; it ends\nwith the evaluation of the results by the same researcher and developers. The\nnext iteration is planned as an answer to the changes in thinking that the expe-\nrience provoked in both the researcher and the developers.

The need to respond to change also keeps the result\nlightweight; the heavier the technical footprint of a solution - that is, the more\nsoftware and hardware needed ~ the harder it is to swap out parts of the solu-\ntion for more suitable technologies.

This community aspect ensures that the components\nand software libraries produced do not exclusively cater to the needs of the\nowning institution. The shared stake that a development community has in a\ncertain tool is one of the most important properties that drives the focus on\npurpose and application; moreover, it ensure an incentive to maintain and sup-\nport development as long as the tool serves a purpose. The possibility is very\nreal, of course, that maintenance and support will dwindle and an application\nmay die if primary users lose the need for a tool. 1 wonder though if this is a\nproblem: unused tools should die rather than become a burden on already\nscarce development and support capacity. In this sense lightweight approaches\nare also self-validating.\n\nFrom Encoding to Modeling,\nthe Changing Research Practice\n\nPart of my argument against large research infrastructures developed in a top-\ndown fashion is that they bear a heavy inflexible footprint in their technology\nand standards, and are therefore ill-suited to supporting the heterogeneous and\nephemeral characteristics of humanities data and research. One could argue that\nthis is not a problem as long as large digital infrastructures are aimed only at\nhosting and safeguarding research data. Given machine-negotiable access ser-\nvices to that data, then any tool of any kind might be applied. Tools that are\nrelatively easy to generalize (concordancing services for instance) could be\nmaintained more stably on such an infrastructure too. Yet this would still allow\nfor ‘agile development space’ to add and use tools on less institutionalized\ninfrastructure.\n\nHowever, digital tools in the humanities are becoming an expression of re-\nsearch itself. Until recently one could probably maintain that, within the digital\ntextual scholarship community, the foremost technology used to capture text\nstructure semantics was through encoding (markup), preferably in TEIL-XML\nformat. The encoded digital text was therefore the most prominent and useful\ndigital expression or result that could be sustained. But with more and more\ntools appearing that process, interpret, and visualize text, this is changing. A\ntool like CollateX is based on a carefully analyzed heuristic model of the scho-\nlarly text collation process which is dissected into discrete steps, each of which\nis modeled into code (Haentjens Dekker 2011). CollateX in itself thus\nrepresents a heuristic model for text variation analysis. But there are more ways\nto approach text variation analysis. The nCritic (<https://github.com/tla/\n\n177\n\f"

This type of lightweight, highly specific, research-driven tool\ndevelopment is therefore reminiscent of ~ and possibly even a reification of ~\nthe ideas on modeling put forward by people such as Orlandi and McCarthy\n(Rockwell 2012). It would plainly defy the purpose of large scale digital infra-\nstructures for humanities if they were not also to host and sustain such tools. It\nis akin to saying “we will maintain the text, but not the book”.\n\nIn the case of digital textual scholarship, the encoded text file will not be the\nstart and end of humanities text data capture and storage. As Peter Boot and I\nargue (Van Zundert 2011), future digital scholarly editions will look less like\nself-contained digitized books. Digital editions will instead be interfaces for\nengaging with digital text, created by combining services that process text and\nrelated content from sources distributed on the Internet. For instance, a simple\ndigital edition might be constructed from a few independently hosted services.\nOne fetches the facsimile images from a server at the British Library, the\nsecond fetches the transcribed text from a server of Sankt Gallen University. A\nthird service combines the results in a pageable representation of text and im-\nages per page. Such a ‘Web 2.0° web services based edition can be fitted with a\ntool to register user comments that are stored on yet another server offering an\nannotation service. The edition might also be fitted with a tool to suggest tran-\nscription corrections or even to directly edit the transcription. These Service\nOriented Architecture ~ or SOA for short ~ possibilities that are now becoming\nthe bread and butter of Internet technology have the potential to transform\ndigital scholarly editions from what are essentially reading interfaces into vir-\ntual research environments based on distributed technology. Any large digital\nresearch infrastructure claiming to support digital scholarship should be able to\nsupport and maintain distributed ‘Web 2.0° editions. Moreover, it should be\nable to capture the potentially perpetual modifications and additions that are\nmade to the edition as it is used and annotated by researchers and other users.\n\nThese ideas on text as data that can be processed, text that can be trans-\nformed through services, and scholarly editions as working environments for\ntexts in indefinite progress ~ ideas that are, of course, by no means new (cf. for\nexample Buzzetti (2006), Robinson (2005) ~ are technological avenues for text\nthat we need to explore ~ both to discover the potential representations and\nuses of text in the virtual environment, and also to add to our formalized under-\nstanding of the properties of text. It is this kind of fluidity and virtuality of text\nas data that should be supported by any generalized humanities infrastructure.\nBut given that interfaces and services for these ideas are still very early imma-\n\n178\n\f"

In fact, even limiting support for the ideas for representing text and inter-\nfaces to what is possible with current mainstream internet technology, along the\nlines that Pierazzo (Pierazzo 2011) or Rosselli Del Turco (Del Turco 2012)\npoint out ~ that is, even if we refrain from trying to extend our models for text\nrepresentation and interaction beyond what we can practically achieve today —\nthe task is beyond any currently feasible large-scale generalized digital infra-\nstructure for the humanities.\n\nIn other words, transformed by digital technology, text and digital editions —\ndigital humanities data in general, as a matter of fact ~ become fluid, ‘living’,\nreaching a state wherein they are perpetually in a digital information lifecycle.\nProviding a generalized digital infrastructure for the humanities for such vola-\ntile research data - and indeed for such volatile data modeling — is a huge de-\nvelopment and maintenance challenge. And even if a generalized model for\nvolatile data could be delivered right now, there would be the additional com-\nplication of providing various specific user interfaces for it. For again one size\nwill not fit all here as each researcher will have individual needs and require-\nments to put forward ~ not on the basis of some narrow-minded aesthetics but\non the basis of specific research questions. What is needed is not just the sup-\nport to store text representation according to encoding models. To really sup-\nport textual scholarship and research also requires the ability to model text and\ntext interaction into dynamic data models and algorithmic models, to put those\nmodels to work as research-specific services on the infrastructure in question,\nand to support change in the models. That is rather different from implement-\ning a current state-of-the-art markup approach for digital editions on an institu-\ntionalized grid.\n\nSustainability\n\nOne of the oft-stated purposes of large-scale digital humanities infrastructure is\nto preserve and safeguard the tools and data pertaining to humanities research\nthat are produced, and to share the technical and organizational burden for that\ntask. Digital libraries would feel they have a stake in here, and a role to play\n(Van Zundert 2011). The assumption that digital libraries and research institu-\ntions seem to make is that institutional collaboration on the erection and upkeep\nof such an infrastructure will be a good warrant that the infrastructure will be\nthere indefinitely. In part this is true, for indeed it is unlikely that libraries,\nuniversities, and research institutions will vanish any time soon. And indeed\nspreading or sharing the burden for digital archival infrastructure is sensible as\nthe risks of administering data, tools, and services at just one institute ~ or even\nworse on one machine ~ are severe, of course. Monolithic systems are single\npoints of failures. But what is more, the burden of sustaining local monoliths\n\n179\n\f"

            "result": "may even pose a threat to the institution of overburdened resources. The insti-\ntution needs, at the very least, redundant storage and server capacity to ward\noff the greatest risks of technical failure. But then, one needs safe remote cop-\nies too. System, server, network and application support are needed for the\nmaintenance of ail machines and all software on them. And as tools and data\ncome in all varieties, the list of scarce IT knowledge of software and standards\nthat needs to be available ‘in-house’ explodes within a short space of time, and\nstarts eating away valuable human and non-human resources. Thus sustainabil-\nity through institutional maintenance of digital infrastructure is a large and\npotentially explosive burden.\n\nHowever, institutional stability and integrity are not the only aspects we\nshould take into account. In the preceding section I suggest that there is unlike-\nly to be a very clear cut off in the future between ‘dead archival data’ or ‘fina-\nlized editions’ on the one hand, and ‘living data’ and/or ‘works in progress’ in\nvirtual research environments. The distinction between those concepts and ~\ncrucially - between the technical implementation of the concepts may become\npermeable, may even fully disappear. The classic information lifecycle (Boon-\nstra 2004) might soon no longer have a neat off ramp where results are ported\nto a stable archival silo. Rather in contrast, the information in a majority of\ncases will keep spinning around within that very lifecycle. The current push of\nInternet technology towards Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) may very\nwell reinforce this change. Known by their buzzword “The Cloud’, service\noriented architectures are nothing more or less than data-publishing software\nprocesses running as services on the same Internet we already know. Until now\nthe Internet has been mainly used to ‘display data’ for human consumption; the\ninnovation of the last few years is the exposure of data in machine negotiable\nform and the ability to publish services, ie. software that can process data\nexposed on the Internet. To put it more simply perhaps: where formerly you\nwould necessarily have data and software working together on a single com-\nputer, processes and data may in the future be stored and executed on any com-\nputer connected to the Internet. We may at some point not even know which\ndata is on what computers, and any service may be executed by various ma-\nchines. A service may even be executed in part by one machine and in part by\nanother. This may sound like dangerous chaos to a librarian, but from an IT\nperspective it makes perfect sense if sustainability for tools and data is key.\nWhen data and services can be replicated automatically on any node of a large\nnetwork of computers, the chances of date loss due to a single point of failure\nare virtually zero. This strategy of sustaining data and tools is based on keeping\nredundant copies and ensuring that services and data are stored in several re-\ndundant locations. In fact, this is exactly what LOCKSS (<http://lockss.\nstanford.edu/>, Rosenthal 2011) is doing. The approach is sound and is based\nin essence on the same principles that make guerilla warfare the hardest to\n\n180\n\f"

Service Oriented Architecture, Cloud Computing, Distributed\nComputing are all technologies that push in the direction of an Internet of ser-\nvices where institutions, industry and individuals share computing and storage\ncapacity on an on-demand basis. These are highly cost-efficient ways to main-\ntain and distribute network capacity. These are also technologies where sustai-\nnability is a part of the running system as it were, rather than a task of separate\nstorage silos and institutions. Such technologies are more in tune with a re-\nsearch perspective wherein we work with living and fluid data objects in conti-\nnuous research life cycles. These are also the sorts of technologies that enable\nus to advance our data modeling and analysis.\n\nModeling Workflows with Microservices\n\nOver the last few years, the Interedition project has been experimenting with\nservice-oriented models as described here. The project has delivered several\nweb-enabled workflows based on the idea of microservices. Microservices are\nspecialized instances of web services that take their data in JSON format over a\nRESTiike protocol, and return the data processed in a way that is meaningful\nwithin a certain research workflow. This is arguably the most lightweight im-\nplementation that is possible for any web service. JSON (<http:/Avww.\njson.org/>) is the simplest data structure format in existence, yet is expressive\nenough to encapsulate almost any higher-order data structure such as XML or\nobject models. A more basic client-server communication protocol than REST\n(<http://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>) is hard to ima-\ngine.\n\nIndividual microservices represent discrete steps of scholarly processes that\ncan be individually automated (Haentjens Dekker 2011). Such microservices\ncan be chained together into ‘pipes’ to construct larger workflows for scholarly\npurposes. Prototype webservice-based workflows that Interedition delivered\nconstituted amongst others a full textual collation workflow (<http://collatex.\nsourceforge.net/)’, a fully-implemented prototype OAC annotation service\n\n2 The current demo package for CollateX is offered not as a chain of microservices online,\nbut as a Java Webstart application able to run on any local computer. This is due to re-\nsponse time constraints by Google App Engine, to which the web service chain could not\ncomply under prototype conditions. Interedition promised proof-of-concept prototypes\nonly, however, demand for a production level implementation was concrete enough that the\ndecision was made to publish the CollateX too! in this form too.

These microservices\nrun on no other infrastructure than the current Web and need no other support\nthan standard off-the-shelf open source server platforms. In other words, apart\nfrom the Internet they need no additional infrastructure.\n\nThese super-lightweight humanities research microservices have considera-\nble advantages over any integrated or purpose-built large digital infrastructure.\nThey can be deployed on any mainstream server platform ~ or, for that matter,\n‘in the cloud’. They are open source and collaboratively built. This ensures\nshared knowledge about their inner architecture and implementation, and gives\nother developers the ability not only to maintain them but also to reuse them.\nThey are implementation-agnostic: it does not matter if they are implemented\nin Java, Ruby, Perl, R, or any other language; as long as they serve JSON over\na REST protocol they can be incorporated into a scholarly workflow. This\nimplies that anybody who can code can contribute, regardless of their preferred\nimplementation language or architecture. This makes the whole philosophy\nbehind microservices open, inclusive, lightweight, and sustainable.\n\nThe Broken Business Model\n\nTrue modeling of humanities research data and heuristics through code and\nthrough the data itself actually requires very little in the way of specialized\nlarge-scale humanities research infrastructure. What those requirements amount\nto is the availability of enough mainstream network, storage, and computing\ncapacity, which is to say: ‘enough Internet’. There is little rationale to put more\neffort than is needed to organize that on the technical infrastructure level. The\nmost useful thing big infrastructure programs could do, therefore, is to make a\nconsiderable investment in an academic cloud, allowing access, storage and\nexecution to any member of the academic endeavor. We all have email, why\nnot let us all have access to an academic computing cloud? The technologies\nfor basic functions such as single sign-on, governance, persistent addressing,\nservice brokerages and orchestration are all readily available through industry.\nEven storage - which may seem like a problem because we are ever storing\nmore data ~ will rapidly become trivial as long as Moore’s Law (<http://en.\nwikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law>) still holds.\n\nOf course there are some darker wisps of cloud in this blue sky scenario.\nThe foremost in my view is that the autonomous cloud approach that potential-\nly lies in the future can make accounting rather opaque for institutions who\nwish to know exactly which data and services they are hosting, or whether their\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncroservice chain is also on line at hitp://interedition-tools.appspot.com/ but is likely to show\nresponse time errors.\n\n182\n\f"

            "result": "effort and financial investment are indeed completely proportional to their use\nof cloud facilities. To understand this we must return for a moment to the idea\nof the digital scholarly edition. Now that the edition might well be a perpetually\nactive research environment into which tools can be plugged in and out, where\ndo the responsibilities for maintaining such an edition lie? How do we find the\npoint at which the developing research institution transfers maintenance to a\npreservation-aimed institution, such as a digital library? This broken business\nmodel is rather more of a problem to be solved for the future than the infra-\nstructure issue.\n\nThis problem, complex as it is, will be further complicated when we move\nfrom ‘Web 2.0’ digital humanities to ‘beyond web’ technology. The “Web 2.0°\ndigital edition as a virtual research environment based on orchestrated distri-\nbuted microservices may sound like a farfetched idea ~ although it is not so\noutlandish, inasmuch as Huygens ING is implementing the model for its eLa-\nborate digital edition framework ~ but the future is even more spectacular. IBM\npredicts (<http://www.research.ibm.com/autonomic/>) that autonomous sys-\ntems and autonomous computing are the next step in general computing and\ndigital networks. Autonomous computing is the idea that code and data can\nexist on a digital network such as the Internet independently of any local serv-\ner. As things stand today, one needs to deploy (i.e. install) services on a specif-\nic server, which means that the service will run on that specific machine, inde-\nfinitely in principle. Autonomous computing ‘liberates’ an algorithm ~ and any\nassociated data ~- from its confines on a local server, as a bird from its cage.\nThe application can travel to any other server in the network based on where\nthe network needs its services the most. Hence imagine: this is not your text\nfile moving from one computer to another by mail, but it’s your text processor\nmoving ~ while running. The utility of this is that software can travel to where\nit is needed and can be executed in the proper context. The ability to move\nactive code and data as singular digital object through a network opens up the\npossibility to think of ~ for instance — a digital scholarly edition as ‘living data’\nin the sense that it is fluid and editable anywhere, encapsulated by all the code\nand interface that is needed to edit, authorize modifications to, re-version, or\nannotate the data, or perform any other imaginable task. We might then begin\nto think of the book as an active object with inbuilt behavior. As a researcher of\nliterary texts and a developer of digital literary curation and analysis tools,\npondering the potential of such a transformation of text into the digital is far\nmore exciting to me than the properties of any current digital infrastructure\ntechnology.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe inevitable conclusion from all of the above must be that, at least as far as\ndigital humanities research is concerned, there is little benefit to be expected\n\n183\n\f"
