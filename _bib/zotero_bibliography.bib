  abstract = {Nancy Cartwright argues for a novel conception of the role of fundamental scientific laws in modern natural science. If we attend closely to the manner in which theoretical laws figure in the practice of science, we see that despite their great explanatory power these laws do not describe reality. Instead, fundamental laws describe highly idealized objects in models. Thus, the correct account of explanation in science is not the traditional covering law view, but the `simulacrum' account. On this view, explanation is a matter of constructing a model that may employ, but need not be consistent with, a theoretical framework, in which phenomenological laws that are true of the empirical case in question can be derived. Anti-realism about theoretical laws does not, however, commit one to anti-realism about theoretical entities. Belief in theoretical entities can be grounded in well-tested localized causal claims about concrete physical processes, sometimes now called `entity realism'. Such causal claims provide the basis for partial realism and they are ineliminable from the practice of explanation and intervention in nature.},

  abstract = {Models as Mediators discusses the ways in which models function in modern science, particularly in the fields of physics and economics. Models play a variety of roles in the sciences: they are used in the development, exploration and application of theories and in measurement methods. They also provide instruments for using scientific concepts and principles to intervene in the world. The editors provide a framework which covers the construction and function of scientific models, and explore the ways in which they enable us to learn about both theories and the world. The contributors to the volume offer their own individual theoretical perspectives to cover a wide range of examples of modelling, from physics, economics and chemistry. These papers provide ideal case-study material for understanding both the concepts and typical elements of modelling, using analytical approaches from the philosophy and history of science.},

They seek to outline the development of a digital research infrastructure localized in the science and engineering domain and framed within the concept of e-Science. The authors define the primary characteristics of e-Science as big data and big structures such as the grid and high performance computing. They will attempt to demonstrate the transfer of the e-Science paradigm to the humanities and to assess what worked and what did not. They then suggest how thinking about technology and infrastructure through and within the humanities can lead to transformation and finish with a suggestion that the future for humanities research infrastructures is best framed around the emerging idea of a humanities specific digital ecosystem."

In many manuscripts we can find traces of the historical reading situation; for example, pointing hands, marginal notes, etc. Such signals had an important function for the medieval reader, but they are rarely put forward in modern printed editions. I maintain that many of these paratextual notes can be explained with the help of hypertext theory, and be emphasized in a digital edition. I discuss this possibility by giving some examples from Scandinavian composite manuscripts. I show how digital technology together with new philological theory can give new life to medieval manuscripts, as digital editions together with the use of linking give the modern reader a deeper understanding of manuscript culture. This is possible because new philology revalues the concrete textual witnesses of a manuscript and takes each single version of a text into discussion. A printed edition is a much too clumsy tool if the aim is to give the modern reader a clear view of the uses of manuscript during the Middle Ages, but with digital technology an edition can be more complete by applying different layers of information.},

  abstract = {In writing about mid-nineteenth century newspapers, Walter Benjamin notes the prevalence of the r\'eclame, a paid publisher's advertisement printed instead as an editorial notice and hidden within the miscellany of the page. For Benjamin, this ``corruption of the press'' was so widespread as to necessarily inform any ``history of information'' (28). But Benjamin's insight can also apply by corrupting the very word ``corrupt'' to mean something like ``error.'' As bibliographers and textual critics well know, it is hardly possible to write the history of information without attention to errors, accidents, variants, and changes\textemdash the dynamics of corruption and correction that},

Collingwood saw one of the main tasks of philosophers and of historians of human thought in uncovering what he called the ultimate presuppositions of different thinkers, of different philosophical movements and of entire eras of intellectual history. He also noted that such ultimate presuppositions usually remain tacit at first, and are discovered only by subsequent reflection. Collingwood would have been delighted by the contrast that constitutes the overall theme of the essays collected in this volume. Not only has this dichotomy ofviews been one ofthe mostcrucial watersheds in the entire twentieth-century philosophical thought. Not only has it remained largely implicit in the writings of the philosophers for whom it mattered most. It is a truly Collingwoodian presupposition also in that it is not apremise assumed by different thinkers in their argumentation. It is the presupposition of a question, an assumption to the effect that a certain general question can be raised and answered. Its role is not belied by the fact that several philosophers who answered it one way or the other seem to be largely unaware that the other answer also makes sense - if it does. This Collingwoodian question can be formulated in a first rough approximation by asking whether language - our actual working language, Tarski's "colloquiallanguage" - is universal in the sense of being inescapable. This formulation needs all sorts of explanations, however.},

But if we were to let go of this conviction, Bruno Latour asks, what would the world look like? His book, an anthropology of science, shows us how much of modernity is actually a matter of faith. What does it mean to be modern? What difference does the scientific method make? The difference, Latour explains, is in our careful distinctions between nature and society, between human and thing, distinctions that our ancestors, in their world of alchemy, astrology, and phrenology, never made. But alongside this purifying practice that defines modernity, there exists another seemingly contrary one: the construction of systems that mix politics, science, technology, and nature. The ozone debate is such a hybrid, in Latour's analysis, as are global warming, deforestation, even the idea of black holes. As these hybrids proliferate, the prospect of keeping nature and culture in their separate mental chambers becomes overwhelming--and rather than try, Latour suggests, we should rethink our distinctions, rethink the definition and constitution of modernity itself. His book offers a new explanation of science that finally recognizes the connections between nature and culture--and so, between our culture and others, past and present.},

It is also suggested that from high quality diplomatically encoded source texts it is possible to automatically extract texts that either directly or with some further encoding/editing can function as a base text for editions of different types and which build on different editorial philosophies. The editions produced at the Wittgenstein Archives in Bergen and in the project Henrik Ibsen's Writings in Oslo are used as examples of projects supporting the author's arguments.},

Accordingly, it may be argued that the model of the collaborative project-based edition need only to be extended, to become `social'. This article questions that thesis, demonstrating the problems that can arise with collaborative projects applying digital methodologies to scholarly work through analysis of the Shakespeare Quartos and the European Virtual Museum Transnational Network projects and arguing that the term `collaboration' needs critical examination. Indeed, to the extent that `collaboration' may be closed, and may serve narrow scholarly purposes, it can be the antithesis of `social'. In place of project-based collaboration, this essay proposes that we see `social' editions as grounded in communities, not in collaboration, and that the principle upon which they should be built is (following Shirky) `design for generosity'. This implies a different role for the editors and scholars from the academy: rather than the leaders of collaborations, we may become key participants in, and enablers of, communities. In turn, this mandates a loss of control: generosity means allowing others to use what is given freely, including in ways not foreseen, and even opposed, by those who created the data. For academics who are used to identifying control with assurance of quality, this is a difficult step. Wide adoption of the Creative Commons Attribution licence (without the `non-commercial' restriction) would take us far towards these aims.},

It is precisely these interpretative aspects of humanities research that are often felt as being at odds with the perceived scientific empirical paradigm found in computer science and software design. The digital humanities is a field where this clear tension between hermeneutical narrative and quantified patterns surfaces. This tension calls urgently for a fundamental dialog between humanities and computer science about the status of a hermeneutics as an imperative to humanities research, and about a humanities-informed hermeneutics of code, algorithms, and quantification.},

This debate has a disciplinary, historical, and institutional basis and is backdropped by considerable interest in the digital humanities from universities, funding agencies, scholars, and others.

The problem is compounded by differences in genre, register and style, but in particular by our frequent dependence on much later copies of lost originals. This article examines how a method of classification with flexible time intervals has been developed for a corpus of medieval Irish annals (c.700\textendash c.1600). It is shown that the method can deal successfully with an unparsed, complex corpus containing contaminated data. A method of extending the model from good quality, uncontaminated data to more complex texts is also demonstrated by identifying temporal characteristics and typical entries in the high-quality source.},

It is precisely these interpretative aspects of humanities research that are often felt as being at odds with the perceived scientific empirical paradigm found in computer science and software design. The digital humanities is a field where this clear tension between hermeneutical narrative and quantified patterns surfaces. This tension calls urgently for a fundamental dialog between humanities and computer science about the status of a hermeneutics as an imperative to humanities research, and about a humanities-informed hermeneutics of code, algorithms, and quantification.},

The necessary generalizations and standardizations, management and development processes that large infrastructures need to apply to cater to wholesale humanities are at odds with well-known aspects of innovation. Moreover, such generalizations dose off many possibilities for exploring new modeling and computing approaches. The author argues that methodological innovation and advancing the modeling of humanities data and heuristics is better served by flexible small-scale research focused development practices.
